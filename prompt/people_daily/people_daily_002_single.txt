A girl in a white shirt and gray plaid skirt performs push-ups on green artificial grass, skillfully picking up various colored cones—green, orange, and yellow—as she crawls through bright yellow hula hoops laid out in a line. In the background, five children dressed in school uniforms with blue skirts stand against an orange wall, clapping rhythmically to encourage her progress. The scene is well-lit, highlighting the vibrant colors of the equipment and the students' attire, creating an energetic atmosphere at Park Public School.
