A young girl with wet, dark hair in a red shirt and black pants walks along a concrete sidewalk under clear blue skies, holding a small red lollipop stick near her mouth. An adult's hand reaches out towards her as she moves past large glass windows reflecting the sky and trees, stopping briefly to look around before continuing forward toward a building marked "113" on a blue door frame. The window displays text advertising various programs like early preschool and after-school care, while sunlight casts soft shadows across the textured brick wall of the structure.
