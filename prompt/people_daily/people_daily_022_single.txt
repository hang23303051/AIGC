A young girl, wearing a purple t-shirt with cartoon characters and the text 'BE KIND,' stands in a shopping cart at Costco Wholesale. She places her hands on her ears before sitting down inside the red metal shopping cart labeled 'COSTCO WHOLESALE.' An orange bag of Cheetos is placed next to her within the cart. A hand, clad in a black sleeve, holds onto the handle of the cart as the child looks around, observing her surroundings under bright overhead lighting typical of a large retail store filled with other shoppers and various items displayed throughout the space.
