shot1: In a well-lit hotel room with beige walls, two unmade beds with white linens are positioned side by side against a wooden headboard; above the right bed hangs a framed floral painting. A person in light-colored pajamas stands near an open window with cream and gold curtains, opening them further to let bright sunlight flood the room while another individual lies on the left bed partially covered under sheets before sitting up and playfully throwing pillows at both themselves and their companion who is now standing by the window. The first person then jumps onto the bed, causing it to bounce as they move around energetically, joined later by a third person wearing pink shorts who sits on the edge of the same bed adjusting their hair after which all three appear ready for the day amidst the cheerful morning atmosphere.
shot3: A person in a yellow top and light blue jeans is applying makeup with a brush while holding a compact mirror, standing near another person who is sitting on a bed covered with white sheets; the room features beige curtains that are partially drawn to reveal natural light filtering through sheer fabric.
