A woman in a black dress and white backpack, holding a polka-dot umbrella with dark blue fabric and colorful dots, walks down a sunlit sidewalk. Beside her, a child wearing a pink backpack and beige umbrella stands slightly bent over, shielding themselves from the bright sunlight. The scene is set against a backdrop of clear blue skies, green trees, and residential houses under strong natural light, creating distinct shadows on the ground. Both individuals move forward together along the concrete path, maintaining their positions relative to each other as they proceed through the sunny environment.
