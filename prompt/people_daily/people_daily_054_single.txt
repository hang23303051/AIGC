A woman with gray hair tied back, wearing a gray hoodie and a black shirt underneath, sits at a table in a well-lit office room, looking to her right. Across from her, a bald man dressed in a black jacket over a pink checkered shirt is seated, facing the woman as they engage in conversation. Another person, partially visible on the left side of the frame, appears to be sitting further down the table, while an empty chair stands next to the glass whiteboard mounted on the wall behind them. The background features a logo reading "esVAL" along with some text below it, indicating a professional setting where all individuals are actively participating by listening and talking.
