A person dressed in black athletic wear, including a long-sleeve top and pants with orange accents, is seen engaging with an outdoor obstacle course. They are holding onto three vertically stacked tires suspended by ropes from wooden poles, positioned on a green rubberized ground surface under a partly cloudy sky. The individual maneuvers the upper tire while maintaining balance on the lower ones, surrounded by autumnal trees with red leaves, white hanging bags, streetlights, and distant buildings behind a fence.
