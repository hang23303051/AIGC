A group of people, some wearing casual clothing and face masks, walk down a bustling urban street lined with tall buildings under a partly cloudy sky. A red car drives past the pedestrians as they pause near various signs, including one indicating "PARKING" to the right and another warning not to block the driveway. The scene shifts slightly to reveal more details: two large Christmas trees decorated with ornaments stand prominently in front of a building labeled "UNIVERSITY OF Baguio," while other individuals holding pink and maroon umbrellas navigate the sidewalk below power lines crisscrossing overhead.
