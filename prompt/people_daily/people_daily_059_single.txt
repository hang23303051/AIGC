A woman in a black short-sleeved shirt, with her hair tied up in a bun, is slicing a pineapple on a wooden cutting board placed on a white countertop. She uses a large knife to cut the yellow fruit into even slices, holding it steady with her left hand while maneuvering the knife with her right. The kitchen background features light-colored cabinets, a window with blinds partially open, and various appliances including a stand mixer and a sink area where a blue cup sits near the faucet. Natural light illuminates the scene, highlighting the texture of the pineapple's skin and flesh as each piece falls onto the cutting board below.
