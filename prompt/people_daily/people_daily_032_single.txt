A young child in a pink dress with sparkly details and matching shoes walks hand-in-hand with an adult wearing a red shirt, beige pants, and white sneakers along a concrete path next to a textured white wall. The group approaches a large glass door framed in red trim; another person stands nearby holding the door open as they prepare to enter. Sunlight casts clear shadows on the ground, highlighting the bright outdoor setting where other people are visible through the reflective glass of the entrance.
