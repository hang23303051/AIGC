A man, wearing a red shirt with a white logo on the sleeve and gray pants, squats barefoot on a dirt ground next to a body of water. He is handling a dirty fishing net that features both orange and white mesh sections, carefully pulling it apart over a blue tarpaulin spread out beneath him. The scene captures his focused effort as he works near the edge of the muddy shore, where some green vegetation can be seen in the background.
