Three people, dressed in traditional attire with white robes and colorful tops—pink, black, and purple—perform a dynamic dance on a city sidewalk at night. The person in the center wears a white robe over a black shirt and green pants, while the others wear gray skirts (left) and white skirts (right). A white SUV is parked nearby, and various vehicles drive by under bright streetlights as pedestrians walk in the background.
