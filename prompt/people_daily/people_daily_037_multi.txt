The scene changes to reveal racks lined with predominantly white garments against a gray brick wall backdrop as a person dressed in black walks down the aisle taking a selfie in the mirror while holding their phone up high, followed by another individual standing partially visible through an open wooden door adjusting their pants and looking at the camera with a smile.

shot3: A woman in a black jacket and white top, sitting at a restaurant table with an olive plate on it, smiles as another person pours red wine from a small glass into a large wine glass placed upside down over the rim of her own upright glass; she holds up two glasses to clink them together while other people are visible in the background.
