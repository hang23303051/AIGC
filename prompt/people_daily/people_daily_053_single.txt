A man stands in front of a colorful mural, wearing a black cap with "FAL" printed on it and a gray t-shirt that features the text "KEN JOHNSON CODE ★ FOCUSUP FACTOR DRIVEN BY CHOICE IT'S A JOURNEY." The background includes vibrant graffiti art depicting various abstract designs and characters. He appears to be talking directly to the camera under bright daylight, which casts clear shadows around him. Behind him, there are large bags or containers painted as part of the mural, adding depth to the scene.
