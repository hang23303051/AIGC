In a well-lit aircraft cabin, a woman in a white uniform with dark epaulets and black pants carefully adjusts the tie of a man standing still. The man, also in a white uniform adorned with various badges and an ID card on a blue lanyard, stands at ease with his hands behind his back. Behind them, storage compartments labeled 'IndiGo' are visible, along with overhead panels featuring safety instructions and equipment. Soft lighting from above illuminates the scene, highlighting the professional attire and focused interaction between the two individuals.
