A man, wearing a long-sleeved orange crew-neck sweater and blue jeans, sits on a wooden stool against a black curtain backdrop. He alternates between clasping his hands together in front of him and making hand gestures while talking, suggesting an engaged conversation or explanation. The lighting is soft and even, highlighting the texture of his clothing and the smooth surface of the dark background, which remains static throughout the scene. His posture shifts slightly as he moves his hands, indicating active communication without any significant changes in the setting or additional objects entering the frame.
