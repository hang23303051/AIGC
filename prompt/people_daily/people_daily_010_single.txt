A young woman with long blonde hair, wearing a beige sweatshirt and white pom-pom earrings, stands in the front-center of the frame holding a gold-colored cell phone adorned with circular pop-it fidget elements. She is being gently hugged from behind by a young man who wears a light blue shirt, green cap, and has visible tattoos on his left hand; both individuals are standing close together indoors under soft lighting. The background features neutral-toned walls and minimal decor, creating a calm atmosphere as the couple shares a tender moment while facing forward towards the camera.
