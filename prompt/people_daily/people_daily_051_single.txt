A middle-aged man, wearing a white shirt with small dark patterns and glasses, stands outside a shop on a sunny day, facing slightly to the right. He has a white cap adorned with a yellow and brown band, which complements his attire. Behind him, various colorful shop signs are visible, including red banners for "airtel 4G" and an orange sign for "ezcash," along with green electronic boards displaying text. To the left of the frame, a cluster of white balloons is tied up near the entrance of the shop, adding a festive touch to the bustling street scene where motorcycles and buildings can be seen in the background.
