A person in a vibrant red tribal outfit, barefoot and carrying a woven basket on their back, stands under a banner that reads "25 anos de Aniversario" (25 years of Anniversary), preparing to swing a stick at a colorful piñata attached to a wooden structure. The scene is set outdoors at night, illuminated by artificial lighting, with an audience seated around the perimeter watching attentively. As the woman swings the stick, people observe from the sidelines, creating a lively atmosphere filled with anticipation and cultural celebration.
