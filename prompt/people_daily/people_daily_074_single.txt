A man and a woman are holding hands, standing side by side in an elegantly lit room with soft white walls. The man is dressed in a black tuxedo adorned with gold buttons, chains, and a bowtie, wearing a sleek cloak that drapes over his shoulders; he stands upright on the left, facing forward. The woman beside him wears an ornate dress featuring deep purple velvet fabric intricately embroidered with elaborate gold patterns, complemented by a matching headpiece and layered pearl necklaces, her hand gently clasped to the man's as she looks ahead.
