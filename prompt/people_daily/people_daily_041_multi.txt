The video begins with a view of a door labeled "HALA SPORTOWA" (Sports Hall) in both Polish and English, set against a gray wall adorned with framed pictures. Inside the well-lit gym with blue walls, various exercise equipment like barbells, dumbbells, treadmills, and resistance bands are visible. A woman performs squats while lifting a barbell under supervision, as another man walks on a treadmill nearby; one person holds a red object near wooden climbing structures. The scene shifts to show more individuals: a man takes a selfie in front of a mirror, capturing his reflection alongside others adjusting their hair or sitting on chairs within the spacious room filled with fitness gear.
