A young girl in a pink one-piece swimsuit and pink flip-flops, with black hair tied in a ponytail, stands near a red leather couch shaped like a small chair. She is looking at a blue tote bag on a white table, which has various printed text including "90° pool proven curriculum," "Aqua Tots Swim Schools," and "neighborhood swim school." The room is brightly lit with natural light from large windows, showing people sitting around tables inside the building, while colorful banners hang along the walls. A wall-mounted television above her head displays an image of swimmers, adding to the aquatic theme suggested by the mural behind it that reads, "A LIFETIME OF WATER ADVENTURES STARTS HERE."
