A young girl with curly hair, wearing a pink vest adorned with gold patterns, sits at a speckled granite countertop. She holds a plastic cup filled with red liquid and decorated with white unicorns; the cup has a pink lid. A small silver metal bowl containing a dirty spoon is placed to her left on the counter. The background features brown leather chairs and large windows with blinds, allowing soft natural light to fill the room. An adult hand hands her a tiny marshmallow, which she examines closely while still holding the cup in front of her.
