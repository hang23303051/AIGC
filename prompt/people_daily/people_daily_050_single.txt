A man with a black beard and glasses, wearing a gray baseball cap featuring the "NY" logo and a black shirt, speaks into a silver and black microphone. The dimly lit studio background is dark, emphasizing the close-up view of the person in the center frame. He appears to be engaged in conversation, looking directly at the microphone while holding it steady near his mouth.
