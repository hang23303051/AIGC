A large white airplane with a blue tail is parked at the gate, its nose facing forward on a tarmac under clear skies. Ground staff in yellow vests are actively moving around; one walks towards the plane from the left while another stands near the pushback truck positioned centrally between the aircraft and the jet bridge. The scene captures typical airport ground operations during daylight hours, with additional vehicles like a small utility cart passing by, emphasizing the busy environment of an active runway area.
