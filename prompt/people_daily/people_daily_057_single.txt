A group of women in beige dot-patterned saris sit in a circle on the ground, each holding drumsticks and facing towards the center. To their right, a man dressed in white traditional attire plays a large barrel drum with focused intensity. On the left side of the frame, several men stand observing; one wears a black suit with glasses while another is in a blue vest over a white shirt. The scene is set outdoors under bright sunlight, surrounded by lush greenery, including palm trees and various plants, creating a vibrant garden atmosphere. In the foreground, an elderly man in a light-colored vest faces the performers, adding to the communal feel of the event as people clap along rhythmically.
