A woman in a striped shirt and blue jeans pushes a stroller with a baby dressed in gray, who looks around curiously. Beside her, another woman in a white short-sleeve shirt and beige pleated pants walks while holding a white handbag and adjusting a matching white hat; both women are wearing sunglasses on their shirts. A man in a blue shirt and beige pants follows behind them as they stroll down a dimly lit street at night, surrounded by buildings and fallen leaves scattered on the ground. The scene captures casual conversation between the two women walking side by side, creating a relaxed evening atmosphere.
