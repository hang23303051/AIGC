A man in a patterned shirt and brown pants walks down the sidewalk, passing by trees and parked cars under a partly cloudy sky. The street is lined with various buildings, some featuring classical architecture, while others are more modern, creating a mix of urban textures. Several people walk along the pedestrian path, which is bordered by metal railings and has tactile paving for accessibility. Vehicles move through the intersection, including a red car turning right, as bicycles lean against poles near the crosswalks.
