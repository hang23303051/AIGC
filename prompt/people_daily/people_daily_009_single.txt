A young girl in a colorful floral swimsuit and pink flip-flops walks down a sidewalk, holding a blue bag with the "Tide" logo. She is accompanied by an adult whose hand reaches out to guide her as they pass parked cars and green trees under a partly cloudy sky. The child looks curiously at store windows along the way before entering a brightly lit building labeled "Aqua-Tots Swim Schools," where another person opens the door for her.
