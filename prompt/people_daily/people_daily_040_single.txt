A man in a black shirt, green cap, and tattooed arm dances energetically with a small black dog running on the wooden floor behind him. A woman with long blonde hair, wearing a white tank top and beige skirt, joins him, swinging her hair as they dance together in a well-lit room featuring light-colored walls, sheer curtains, and modern decor including a clock, plants, and decorative items. The scene captures their lively interaction against a cozy background of soft natural light streaming through large windows.
