shot1: A man in a white shirt, black shorts, and sandals bends down on the grassy bank of a pond surrounded by large green lotus leaves with pink flowers; he crouches to reach into the water near his feet while holding a blue plastic pipe with holes that is attached to the ground, then picks up the pipe from the water, inspects it closely as if looking for something inside or under it, pulls out what appears to be a long, thin object resembling a worm, and drops it into a medium-sized white plastic bucket filled with water placed nearby.
shot2: A man in a white shirt, black shorts, and sandals crouches on the grassy ground near a water-filled area surrounded by large green leaves and plants, holding a blue plastic pipe with multiple holes that is attached to the ground; he reaches into the water, picks up something from it, inspects the pipe closely while looking at its end which contains several dark-colored eels or snakes inside, then places his hand over the bucket filled with more of these creatures as part of an activity involving inspecting and handling aquatic life.
