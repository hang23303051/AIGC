A woman in a white crop top and black-and-white striped skirt, with blonde hair, stands on the sandy beach at sunset, swaying her arms while dancing alongside a man wearing a white tank top, light gray shorts, sunglasses, and a straw hat. Between them is a young girl in a pink outfit, also dancing joyfully as they all jump together against the backdrop of calm ocean waves and blue-and-white umbrellas under a clear sky transitioning from day to evening. The scene captures their synchronized movements—jumping, waving, and running across the sand—as soft natural light bathes the trio, creating a lively and carefree atmosphere by the sea.
