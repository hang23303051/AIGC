A young girl in a sparkly pink and blue leotard walks through a brightly lit store, her dark hair falling over her face as she moves toward the counter. The store is filled with colorful swimwear hanging on racks to her right, while behind the glass window at the front of the room, an indoor gymnasium with various levels for gymnastics training can be seen. A woman stands near the entrance door, watching the child who then leans against the white counter, peering into the busy gym area before turning back around.
