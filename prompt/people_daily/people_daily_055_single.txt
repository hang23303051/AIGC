Two young men are sitting at a table in a well-lit kitchen, with one wearing a gray shirt and light blonde hair that has a visible neck tattoo, and the other dressed in a black cap and black shirt. The man in the black shirt is seen picking up potato chips from a large beige bowl filled with various types of snacks, including round and wedge-shaped chips, while playfully offering them to the person in the gray shirt. Both individuals appear engaged in casual interaction, set against a background featuring metallic appliances and shelves stocked with items like red plaid fabric and white containers.
