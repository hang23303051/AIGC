Two individuals walk down a narrow path flanked by tall, golden grass and vibrant red flowers. The person on the left wears a black shirt, black pants, and carries a beige jacket in their hand while keeping it in their pocket, exuding a casual yet composed demeanor. Beside them, the person on the right is dressed in a white long-sleeve shirt, blue jeans, and white sneakers, holding a small pink flower in their outstretched hand as they smile warmly. In the background, a large building with light gray walls stands under soft evening lighting, accompanied by a parked tractor painted in striking blue and yellow hues to the left of the frame.
