A woman in a light-blue, shiny, and smooth fabric dress stands indoors against a yellow wall with abstract patterns. She is wet, wearing gold jewelry including rings and a necklace, and has her hair down while looking upwards. The room features an air-conditioner unit on the wall behind her, and she adjusts her cape-like garment over her head and shoulders before touching her face. Warm lighting illuminates the scene, highlighting the traditional style of her attire as she moves slightly within the frame.
