The background features large glass windows displaying various items, creating a soft, ambient lighting effect that highlights their smooth fabric movements. Their synchronized dance actions are fluid and expressive, moving from side to side as they face each other, showcasing traditional attire against a backdrop of green plants and decorative elements.
