shot5: A man in a white long-sleeve shirt and dark pants holds a red pad against his back, while a woman with long hair wearing a blue cap, light-colored t-shirt, black jeans, and gray sneakers pushes the pad towards him; they are positioned on an indoor field marked with green artificial turf, surrounded by large white tent walls, under bright lighting that highlights their actions as he moves to position the pad around himself and she continues pushing it until it eventually falls onto the ground near some small weights scattered nearby, all beneath a prominent red pole displaying "FAT WORK IS THIRSTY WORK" along with Coca-Cola branding.
shot6: A person in a white long-sleeve shirt and dark pants is on a green field with artificial turf, reaching for two hanging Coca-Cola bottles suspended from red poles; the number "2" appears briefly at the bottom left corner of the screen as he interacts with one bottle before standing up holding another object.
