A man in a white shirt, black cap, and gloves is carrying a light blue wooden chair down the steps of a porch with white railings. He looks towards a worker in a yellow shirt and blue helmet who is loading items into a colorful van parked on the street below. As he walks across the grassy yard, two other men join him—one wearing a red shirt, black cap, and gloves, and the other in a black tank top and gray pants—engaging in conversation as they move forward under bright daylight.
