In a grand, well-lit hall adorned with chandeliers and white walls, a man dressed in a maroon vest with gold embroidery and a beige cap lifts the red veil of a woman wearing a black dress with gold trim and a silver crown. The woman smiles as he adjusts her attire, revealing an intricate pattern on the fabric beneath. Another woman in a red veil stands nearby, observing the scene while guests watch from tables in the background.
