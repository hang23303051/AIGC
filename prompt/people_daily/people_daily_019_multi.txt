shot2: A close-up of a transparent plastic bowl containing several green and white guava slices is shown on a light-colored surface, with the camera zooming out to reveal more sliced guavas in the bowl next to a silver laptop displaying a movie scene about "Wednesday," while nearby are a purple cup, a black rectangular object labeled "THE OPTICAL STYLIST," an iced coffee drink covered with clear plastic wrap and two straws sticking out, all under bright indoor lighting.
