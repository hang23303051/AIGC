shot1: A man in a black sweatshirt with red trim sits and talks to the camera, surrounded by various objects including a tall green plant on the left, a lit table lamp next to a wooden shelf holding books and small items like an action figure, another set of shelves behind him filled with more books, toys, and decorative pieces such as a clock and figurines, all under warm lighting; then the scene transitions to display two Tropicana orange juice cartons labeled "BEFORE" and "AFTER" connected by an arrow on a television screen.
shot2: The television screen displays a before and after image of Tropicana orange juice cartons, with the "BEFORE" label above a white carton featuring an orange illustration and green text, and the "AFTER" label above a yellow carton labeled "100% orange juice made from concentrate," separated by a black arrow pointing right, in what appears to be a dimly lit room.
