A man wearing a black shirt, black cap, and sunglasses on his head is sitting at a wooden table in an outdoor setting with glass windows behind him. He gestures while holding a large black rifle with a red tip, which appears to be made of metal. The text "PREDATOR OD 38 PROMO 2 JUTA 800" is displayed in yellow above him, indicating the model and promotional price of the firearm he demonstrates. Natural daylight illuminates the scene, highlighting the details of both the person and the gun as he moves it slightly for display.
