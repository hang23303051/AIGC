A woman with long, curly hair wearing a large, soft knit leopard-print sweater and blue jeans stands outside near a brick wall and wooden door. She turns around to face the camera as text appears on the screen reading, "and you'll find out who I really am." The scene transitions to her walking towards the camera while holding a phone in her right hand, introducing herself as SB, founder of Digitally SB, which is a full-service social media management and digital media agency based in Nashville, Tennessee. As she speaks, another hand reaches out to shake hers, emphasizing their handshake against the backdrop of red brick flooring and light-colored siding.
