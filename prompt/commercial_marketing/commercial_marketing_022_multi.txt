shot1: In a well-lit industrial setting, two individuals in red hoodies with "MITER" and other text on their clothing are operating machinery; one person moves the sheet of material across a table while another uses tools to adjust it as an automated machine cuts through the black sheet, which is part of a conveyor system labeled "ERDMAN" for high-speed cutting solutions.
shot2: A man in a red shirt and black cap is working on a large metal table, handling flat panels that move along the conveyor belt; another person in a red jacket stands near yellow safety railings with shelves filled with parts behind them while a third individual walks by carrying items towards an area further back where more machinery operates under blue hoses connected to overhead equipment. The workspace features various industrial elements including a trash bin next to the main worker, a screen displaying data like "17/18" and "17/19", several boxes scattered around, and multiple machines involved in processing materials as indicated by the presence of moving components and organized workstations illuminated by bright factory lighting.
