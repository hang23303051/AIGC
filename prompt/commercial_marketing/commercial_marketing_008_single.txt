A person holds a small, white box with black text and a QR code on its back side, which is the packaging for a Google Pixel 7 Pro smartphone. The individual uses their left hand, adorned with a watch, to peel off two adhesive strips from the top of the closed box while rotating it slightly in their hands. Their right hand has clean nails, indicating careful handling as they prepare to open the product's paper packaging against a plain, light-colored background under soft lighting.
