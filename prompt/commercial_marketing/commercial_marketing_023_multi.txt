A woman in a red traditional outfit adorned with intricate henna designs and gold jewelry holds a snack package, her expression shifting to discomfort as she opens it. She then uses a smartphone displaying settings for an IoT chimney by Hindware, which is shown actively venting smoke from the kitchen stove below them. The scene transitions to another couple admiring decorative wall tiles featuring large leaf patterns in soft pastel colors, their hands touching the wallpaper together, creating a sense of connection. A close-up reveals floor tiles with premium designs under warm lighting, where one person kneels on the marble-like surface, wearing a bracelet and ring that catch the light subtly.
