A person opens a purple textured box containing a cloth mat, with the text "TEXTURED WE ARE UP TO 30X52 CM" visible on its side. The unrolled mat features a vibrant Gengar character design and various Pokémon symbols in shades of purple against a dark background, set within a room illuminated by colorful lights from computer screens behind it. As the mat is fully extended, the bold "Pokémon" logo appears prominently at one end, showcasing its detailed pattern and material quality under soft lighting that highlights the textures and colors vividly.
