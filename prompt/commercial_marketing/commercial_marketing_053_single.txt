A person wearing a black sleeve adjusts the bicycle's crank arm, which is silver and black with "ERA" printed on it, ensuring the chain aligns perfectly with the gears. The metallic texture of the bike frame glints under bright lighting in what appears to be a workshop filled with other bicycles. A hand holds a black plastic part labeled "ERA All Mountain Size 165mm/170mm/172.5mm," moving it towards the red and gray metal frame where it fits into a hole for secure attachment. Finally, the fully assembled crank arm, featuring both black and silver components, is shown firmly attached to the bike’s drivetrain, ready for use.
