A person with long brown hair, wearing a black shirt and gray pants, stands upright in a well-lit studio space. She opens a large brown cardboard box labeled "Saint Rocco's Treats Fresh. Local. Quality." on a dark table surface. Inside the box, she takes out a medium-sized cylindrical white container featuring images of dogs as part of its label design. The background includes green chairs, windows, lighting equipment, and another individual working near a backdrop setup.
