A person unzips a dark gray, suede-like case with a handle to reveal new, black Sony over-ear headphones inside. The individual then removes the headphones and displays them while holding both sides of the open case on a light wooden surface adorned with green plants in the background. Next, the person takes out two cables: one is a standard 3.5mm audio cable neatly coiled within the case, and the other is a black USB cable featuring a standard USB connector at one end and a USB-C connector at the other. Throughout the video, the left hand consistently wears a watch with a metal band, emphasizing careful handling of the items against soft natural lighting.
