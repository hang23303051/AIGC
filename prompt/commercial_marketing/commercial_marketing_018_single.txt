The video begins with a close-up of a metal railing on a dimly lit street, featuring a red megaphone and a black bag hanging from it, alongside a signboard displaying rental prices in both Chinese and English. The camera then pans to the right, revealing more details of the urban environment, including another similar setup with an additional small advertisement board next to the main one. As the scene transitions, bright city lights illuminate tall buildings under a clear sky, while text at the top reads "Advertising level 💯 on top." A person is seen walking down the street as the background shifts focus between different parts of the bustling area, highlighting various structures and vibrant advertisements against the evening backdrop.
