A pair of hands with pink painted nails and a ring on the left hand hold a small, white, paper phone box featuring an image of a silver smartphone with three camera lenses. The person carefully opens the solid white box to reveal a new, unboxed silver-white phone inside, displaying its back-facing design prominently against a textured light background. They then remove the sleek metal and plastic device from the packaging, showcasing its smooth surface and detailed rear cameras while rotating it slightly for better viewing. Throughout the sequence, the lighting is soft and even, highlighting the clean lines and modern aesthetic of both the box and the phone as the individual examines them closely in their open palm.
