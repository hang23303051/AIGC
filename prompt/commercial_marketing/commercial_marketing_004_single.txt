A black-and-white hand with a wrinkled, open palm holds a medium-sized watch resting on its surface. The watch features a rose-gold face and a black leather band, standing out against the monochromatic background due to its warm metallic hue. White text appears below the hand, first reading "THE PAST IS ALWAYS TENSE" and then changing to "WEAR YOUR FUTURE," both in bold font centered at the bottom of the frame.
