A white ceramic cup, medium in size and smooth in texture, holds a rich coffee with intricate leaf-patterned latte art on top. Surrounding the central cup are various brown coffee beans and hazelnuts scattered across a solid brown background, creating a warm and inviting atmosphere. The word "COFFEE" appears multiple times in bold, yellow, stencil-style text behind the cup, adding a vibrant contrast to the earthy tones. As the scene progresses, the cup remains stationary at the center while the decorative elements subtly shift positions around it, maintaining focus on the beautifully crafted beverage.
