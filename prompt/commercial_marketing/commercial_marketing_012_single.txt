A hand with red-painted nails holds four small, plastic, bottle-shaped objects in pink, orange, yellow, and green colors against a plain background. The bottles are connected by a white base, which the person carefully removes to separate each individual bottle. Each colorful bottle is then displayed one by one, highlighting their smooth texture and vibrant hues under soft lighting.
