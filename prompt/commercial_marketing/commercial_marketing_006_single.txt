A man in a light gray blazer and black shirt stands against a vibrant purple background with the "24m CONTENT 40th ANNIVERSARY 2024" logo prominently displayed, holding a blue and purple award featuring the number "40." He speaks while gesturing slightly, appearing formal and engaged. Text overlays at the bottom of the screen display questions like "How's AI shaping content's future?" and "Biggest challenge for young content marketers?" along with his name, Vikshant Shetty, and affiliation, DViO Digital, all presented in pink, white, and black text on a dark banner. The scene is well-lit, highlighting the glossy surface of the award and the crisp details of the event backdrop.
