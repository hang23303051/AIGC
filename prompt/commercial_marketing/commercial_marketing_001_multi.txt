shot3: A man in a dark blue jacket with white accents and black pants stands on a stage, speaking into microphones attached to his chest while three robotic dogs move around him; the first robot dog is red and black, walking towards the left side of the stage where bright spotlights shine from below, creating beams that illuminate the scene. The second robot dog has a tan and black body, also moving forward but slightly behind the speaker's right leg position, appearing active as it walks across the reflective floor under the same lighting setup. Meanwhile, the third robot dog, which shares the tan and black color scheme like the second one, falls over onto its back near the center-right area of the stage, indicating an unexpected action or malfunction amidst the performance, all set against a backdrop lit by multiple large light sources casting strong horizontal lines through misty air.
shot4: A person in a dark blue jacket and white shirt, equipped with microphones on their chest, stands to the right of two active medium-sized robot dogs; one black and red dog walks steadily on the left side of the stage under bright spotlights, while another tan and black robot falls onto its back in the middle-right area before attempting to get up as it continues falling over.
