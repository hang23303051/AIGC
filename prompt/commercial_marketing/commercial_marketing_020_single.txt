A young male, wearing a brown t-shirt with the word "ONEIL" on it, is sitting at a wooden table outdoors under a structure with glass windows. He holds a red and black air rifle with a scope and wooden stock in his hands, adjusting its position while talking animatedly. The background features lush green plants and a building with brick walls and metal railings, all bathed in natural daylight. A contact number appears briefly above him as he gestures to emphasize his points about the firearm.
