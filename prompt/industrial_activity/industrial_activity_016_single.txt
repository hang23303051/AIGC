A white robotic arm labeled "Staubli" with a green light on its wrist moves gracefully, grasping various bottles of different colors—red, white, and yellow—with the text "Leuz" visible. The round beige container named "FlexiBowl" holds numerous red and white cylindrical objects arranged in concentric circles around its center. In the background, an industrial setting is faintly visible through glass panels, illuminated by soft lighting that highlights the smooth metallic surfaces of the machinery.
