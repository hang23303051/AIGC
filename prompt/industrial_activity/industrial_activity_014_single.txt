Two light-brown wooden spoons, each with a handle and head fixed in vise clamps, are being precisely machined by white CNC milling machines marked with the number 17. The machines actively carve intricate patterns into the spoon heads, generating yellowish-brown shredded wood shavings that scatter across the work area. A blue flexible hose with a red tip is attached to one of the spoons, likely providing coolant during the machining process. Bright lighting illuminates the scene, highlighting the dynamic movement of the machine spindles and the continuous production of fine wood particles.
