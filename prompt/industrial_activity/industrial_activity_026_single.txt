A person wearing a pink shirt and blue gloves skillfully manipulates glowing orange-red hot metal with tongs, positioning it on a rough-textured black anvil. A large gray metal hammer repeatedly strikes the heated metal piece, which emits bright sparks as it is shaped under intense heat. The background features a stone wall, adding to the rustic workshop atmosphere where precise control over the fiery material is demonstrated through careful handling and powerful hammering actions.
