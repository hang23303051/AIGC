shot1: A wooden handle is being machined on a woodworking machine, with wood shavings accumulating around it as the light-brown cylindrical piece rotates against metal parts; multiple similar handles are aligned in rows within the beige and black CNC machinery branded "Woodmaster," while warning signs like yellow backgrounds with caution text ("danger-zone," "warning") appear alongside silver bird-shaped cutouts from a cutting tool.
shot3: A CNC laser-cutting machine, branded "Ironwood," with a beige and black body featuring vertical slats on the left side, is actively cutting intricate bird-shaped patterns into a silver metal sheet placed on a textured worktable; sparks fly as the small moving cutting tool operates within its operational state, while warning signs in yellow display texts like "DANGER ZONE" and "WARNING" along with various symbols to indicate caution areas.
shot5: A woodworking machine with a beige and black body featuring vertical slats is cutting light brown wooden blocks into smaller pieces, producing wood shavings that fly out as the small moving tool cuts through the material; multiple warning signs in yellow, red, and black are visible on the blue control panel of the operational CNC laser-cutting machine emitting sparks while another person stands near other machines in the well-lit room.
shot7: A CNC machine labeled "PRO-MAX" with a beige and black body, featuring vertical slats on its side, is actively cutting two light-brown wooden handles placed on a yellow platform; the machine's drill bit moves up and down as it carves intricate shapes into the wood, while in the background, another person wearing dark clothing stands near additional machinery, including coiled cables and various equipment scattered around an industrial setting illuminated by bright overhead lighting.
shot8: A CNC machine with a beige and black body, featuring vertical slats on its side, is actively cutting into a light brown wooden block that has grooves in it; the machine emits sparks as it cuts through metal sheets with bird-shaped cutouts while various warning signs including "danger-zone" are visible around it, all set within a well-lit industrial environment where other machines operate.
shot9: In a well-lit room, various machines are visible including a CNC machine with blue and silver metallic parts emitting sparks while cutting metal sheets, surrounded by warning signs in yellow, black, and red indicating danger zones and cautions; nearby is a beige and black vertical-slats machine branded "ironwood" containing bird-shaped cutouts on its surface being worked on by small moving cutting tools, alongside light-brown wooden blocks stacked together, all set against the backdrop of multiple logos such as FUVICO and Woodmaster.
