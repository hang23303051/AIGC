A man in a brown shirt, blue jeans, and a white cap operates a large, rusty machine with a rotating metallic wheel. He is seen working on the metal plate by holding a long-handled tool to shape and clean it while standing next to the machine under dim lighting that highlights the industrial setting filled with various tools and equipment. The silver-colored metal plate lies nearby as he bends over to adjust or inspect his work, demonstrating focused manual labor in a workshop environment.
