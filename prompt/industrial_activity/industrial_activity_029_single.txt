A man in a brown shirt and gloves operates a large, rotating metal lathe machine inside a dimly lit workshop with peeling paint on the walls. Another individual wearing a black long-sleeve shirt with red stripes assists by adjusting tools near the spinning metallic object being shaped. The workspace is cluttered with various mechanical parts and debris scattered around, while bright sparks occasionally fly as the tool makes contact with the moving surface. Both individuals work closely together, focusing intently on refining the cylindrical component of the machinery.
