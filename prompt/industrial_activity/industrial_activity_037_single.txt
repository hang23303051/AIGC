A large gray excavator arm, marked with the number 105 and featuring a red wheel, operates in an expansive open-pit mine under bright daylight. The massive metal bucket, labeled 511 and equipped with teeth, carries dark-gray to black rough rocks as it dumps them into an adjacent loaded train car on rails. White printed text reading "TITAN WORKS" is visible at the bottom of the frame throughout the scene.
