A large, red metallic machine with cylindrical parts and a control panel processes materials under bright lighting, ejecting wood shavings onto a black surface. A person operates the machine by pouring brown tobacco into it, which then dispenses white cigarettes filled with brown tobacco into a collection tray below. The hand of a male individual is shown holding multiple finished cigarettes, displaying their uniform size and texture against the backdrop of the operational machinery. Finally, another close-up reveals hands placing small boxes containing these manufactured cigarettes on a workbench next to more stacks of similar products, highlighting the organized output in an industrial setting.
