shot1: A black brush with dense bristles moves back and forth at the top of a white machine, sweeping small silver metal pieces that fall from above onto a blue conveyor belt; these scattered metallic fragments are then gathered into a pile by the moving brush as they travel forward on the rotating surface.
shot2: A yellow and blue robotic arm, labeled "FANUC LR Mate 200iD," picks up small silver metal pieces scattered on a rotating light blue surface with black bristles at the top left corner; it places some of these shiny metallic components into a container above while sweeping them off to keep the area clear.
shot4: A yellow robotic arm with a blue coiled hose, labeled "Mate 200," picks up small silver metal pieces scattered on a rotating blue platform that also features a white cone-shaped object and is being swept by a black brush at the top right corner; after picking several pieces, the robot places them into an adjacent container while moving to its next position.
shot5: A yellow robotic arm with blue coils, labeled "FANUC LR Mate 200iD," is actively picking up small silver metal pieces scattered on a large round blue surface and placing them onto a conveyor belt system below, while the black brush moves over the top of the metal pieces. The white cone-shaped object remains stationary in the background to the right of the robot's path.
shot6: A yellow robotic arm with blue coils moves a black brush, which is positioned on top of scattered silver metal pieces that are placed onto a blue surface in front of the robot. The white cone-shaped object can be seen to the right and slightly behind the moving mechanical components, all under bright industrial lighting highlighting the metallic textures and colors.
