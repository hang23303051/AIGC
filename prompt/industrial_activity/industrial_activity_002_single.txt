A large red Hitachi ZX350 excavator, equipped with a heavy-duty orange rock bucket featuring sharp teeth, operates in a rocky quarry under bright daylight. The machine actively digs and lifts massive amounts of gray rocks from the ground, repeatedly scooping up debris to feed into a stationary green dumper truck positioned on the left side of the frame. As the process continues, another similar excavator is visible further back, also engaged in loading operations within the rugged terrain filled with loose stones and steep cliffs.
