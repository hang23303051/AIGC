A young man in a blue jacket and white gloves, with short brown hair, stands to the left of a large machine that extrudes green material. The elongated plastic object, smooth in texture and patterned with holes, inflates as it is pulled upward by mechanical arms before deflating again for inspection or adjustment. A woman wearing a blue jacket and white gloves, who has long black hair tied back, uses a red-handled tool to cut and adjust the same piece of inflated green plastic on a table while another person assists her nearby.
