A person holds a teal and blue drill with a metallic hole saw attachment, which is stationary against a light wooden plank on grassy ground. The background features green foliage and scattered brown pine cones. As the scene progresses, the drill bit spins rapidly while drilling into the wood, causing wood shavings to fly off. Later, another close-up shows the spinning drill in action before transitioning to an individual marking holes within a white wooden wall using a yellow tool.
