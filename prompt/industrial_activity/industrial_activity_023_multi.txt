shot1: A yellow and black robotic arm, equipped with a gripping end-effector, is positioned on the left side of the frame, actively picking up small metal components in various colors from a blue surface labeled "FlexiBowl by CTS" that contains sorted gears in silver and black sizes; to the right, a large screen displays graphical information about the process while text in German and English appears at the bottom against a blue background, all within a well-lit industrial setting.
shot2: A robotic arm with a yellow and black gripping end-effector, labeled "SCHUNK," is seen picking up various metal gears in different sizes from a blue surface scattered with both sorted and unsorted circular metallic components featuring teeth. The robot then places these assembled or disassembled small electronic components onto a platform while the device itself moves smoothly within its designated area, all under bright industrial lighting that highlights the silver and gray machinery parts against the clean background of the workspace.
shot3: A yellow and black robotic arm, equipped with a gripper labeled "SCHUNK," is seen picking up small metal gears from a blue surface on the left side of the frame while a large silver cylindrical machine marked "FlexiBowl" stands in the background. The robot's end effector has a distinct yellow-black gripping mechanism, holding several sorted metallic components that are circular and have teeth-like features. On the right side, a blue screen displays information about the GROW Sorting system enabling part separation and assembly, accompanied by white text below it explaining its function for sorting various workpieces. In the foreground, an assembled electronic component featuring both black and blue parts rests on a perforated table beneath the moving robotic arm.
