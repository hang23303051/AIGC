A man in a blue shirt, positioned on the right side of the frame, manipulates and observes a glowing hot iron piece within a large, industrial press machine. Another man in a black shirt stands to the left, also handling the heated metal with long rods while both workers are inside the open cylindrical body of the heavy blue press machine. The scene is set in a well-lit factory environment with visible machinery and Chinese signage hanging from the ceiling, highlighting the intense heat as sparks fly around the molten material being worked upon by the vertical hammer mechanism.
