shot1: A large, gray and rust-colored metal pipe is being processed by a green machine labeled "MEL.PVD BM 2020 No-10," with several workers in safety gear—orange vests, yellow or white helmets—observing the operation; one worker sits on a platform under the pipe while others stand around it as clear blue sky provides bright lighting.
shot2: A large, gray and rust-colored metal pipe is in motion on a platform as several workers are present around it; one worker wearing an orange vest sits under the machine observing its progress while another stands nearby monitoring with a yellow helmet and white shirt, both positioned inside the cylinder's space. Another worker bends down to weld at the base of the moving structure using bright sparks from his torch, donning a blue helmet and orange gloves, also situated within the overlapping area of the massive metallic object. The scene takes place outdoors during daylight hours beneath a clear sky.
shot3: A large gray and rust-colored metal pipe, appearing processed and in-motion as a crane lifts it from below, overlaps with several workers; one worker wearing an orange vest and white helmet is sitting under the machine observing forward, another standing next to the machine monitoring right while facing down, both are inside the moving pipe. Meanwhile, a third worker bends downward for welding, donning a blue helmet, orange vest, red gloves, and brown jacket, actively using a grinder on the edge of the pipe which emits bright sparks against the clear daytime sky backdrop.
shot4: A large, gray and rust-colored metal pipe is being lifted by a yellow crane in an outdoor industrial setting under clear blue skies, with several workers inside the hollow of the pipe; one worker wearing an orange helmet and vest sits observing from within the pipe's interior while another stands nearby monitoring its movement as it hangs suspended above the ground where three other workers are positioned beneath or around it—one bends down welding at the base of the pipe’s inner surface dressed in a blue helmet and orange vest, two others stand close together watching him, all surrounded by stacks of similar pipes on pallets.
shot5: A worker in a green plaid shirt and white helmet uses a grinder on the inner surface of a large, gray metal pipe with rust patches, producing bright orange sparks that fall to the ground; several other workers wearing safety gear including yellow helmets, orange vests, blue helmets, and one in a white hard hat stand around observing or monitoring inside the cylindrical structure under natural light.
