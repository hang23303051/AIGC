shot3: A blue and silver cutter machine operates, holding multiple cylindrical black and silver cutters that are rotating rapidly to carve grooves into brown wooden pieces positioned on a conveyor belt; wood shavings fall from the cutting process into bins below as the drill bit spins smoothly.
shot4: A black and silver metal cutter, with a cylindrical shape and grooves on its surface, is rapidly rotating as it cuts into a brown wooden piece that has parallel grooves being carved smoothly by the machine; wood shavings fly off in all directions from the contact point between the spinning drill bit and the moving wood under the blue and silver housing of the operating cnc machine.
shot5: A blue and silver cutter machine, equipped with multiple black and silver rotating cylindrical cutters (cutter o1), smoothly carves a brown wooden piece (wooden-piece o2) into grooved patterns under its housing (machine o3), producing fine shavings as the wood's texture transitions from rough to smooth.
shot7: A blue and silver cutter machine operates continuously, holding multiple rotating black cylindrical cutters that are cutting brown wooden pieces with parallel grooves into smooth shapes; wood shavings fall onto a reddish-brown carpeted floor below the machine as it feeds more raw material in.
shot8: A blue and silver cutter machine is operating, holding a brown wooden piece with parallel grooves that are being cut by multiple black and silver rotating cylindrical tools; wood shavings scatter around the cutting area as the red lever on the side of the conveyor system remains visible.
