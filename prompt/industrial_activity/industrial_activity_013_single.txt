A person in blue overalls stands to the left of a black chair with a blue book on its seat, observing an operational CNC machine. The large black and red machine features yellow controls, a metallic work table holding a wooden board being cut by a moving red cutting head, and a coiled blue hose running along its right side. In the background, a large blue plastic water tank is visible at the back of the machine, which operates under bright industrial lighting within a spacious workshop filled with shelves and other equipment.
