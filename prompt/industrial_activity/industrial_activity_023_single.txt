A red forklift, branded with the "Flexi" logo in white on its side and a black metal frame at the top bearing "flexi.co.uk," is operated by a male driver wearing an orange high-visibility vest over a black shirt. The operator sits inside the vehicle, facing right, as he skillfully maneuvers the machine through a large warehouse filled with tall gray metal shelves stocked with numerous wrapped packages of various sizes. A significant load of neatly stacked white-wrapped goods rests on a wooden pallet to the left of the forklift, which moves steadily forward along marked pink lines on the concrete floor under bright overhead lighting.
