A yellow industrial machine with visible wear and black bristles presses down on a light-colored wooden plank, smoothing its surface. The wood moves steadily under the press, revealing fine grain patterns as it is flattened by the heavy machinery. Sunlight illuminates the scene, highlighting the texture of both the metal components and the freshly sanded wood. In the background, parts of the blue base structure are partially visible beneath the moving planks.
