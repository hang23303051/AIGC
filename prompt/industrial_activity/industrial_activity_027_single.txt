A large green metal machine, operational and covered in various mechanical parts, dominates the background as a long spiral metal rod spins rapidly on its central axis. White liquid flows continuously over the table where the cutting process occurs, creating a wet surface with visible splashes. Bright orange and yellow sparks flash intermittently from the point of contact between the spinning tool and the spiraled rod, illuminating the scene with dynamic light effects. A person wearing blue clothing closely observes the precise machining operation, ensuring everything functions correctly amidst the industrial setting filled with metallic textures and utilitarian design.
