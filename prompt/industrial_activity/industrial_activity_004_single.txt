A man in blue overalls and a blue shirt, with short hair, stands by a large industrial machine labeled 'PET TECHNOLOGIES,' which is white and purple with multiple control panels and green indicator lights. He opens the chamber of the lit machine, revealing bright orange flames inside, while another person works nearby handling materials from a cardboard box to the right. The well-lit factory environment features various cables hanging above and other equipment visible in the background.
