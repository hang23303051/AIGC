Two robotic arms, one with a black and orange design and the other in blue, are positioned on a sleek, dark gray table illuminated by green LED lighting along its edges. Several people stand around the display, observing as the robots move their grippers over various labeled components like "Smart Vision" and "Linear Motion Control." The background features multiple screens showing different visuals, including text about youth futures, while others watch attentively or hold devices near the setup.
