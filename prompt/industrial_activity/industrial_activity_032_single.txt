The video shows a lead screw with a black threaded rod, gold nut, and silver cylindrical body against a brown wooden background. Printed text in green and white appears on the screen throughout, providing instructions like "LEAD SCREW," "OF FUN WITH THE 😂," "YOU NEED TO GO," "AHEAD AND THREAD IT," and "ONTO THIS PIECE." The metallic strip with holes is visible at the top of the frame, adding to the industrial setting under bright lighting that highlights the shiny metal surfaces.
