In a well-lit industrial workshop with large windows and high ceilings, two men—one in blue overalls and another in a black shirt—are actively working on a machine encased in a white metal frame. The man in blue stands to the left of the machine, holding parts and adjusting its internal components, while the man in black is positioned on the top platform, reaching for additional pieces or making precise adjustments. A third man in blue attire observes from nearby as they collaborate under bright overhead lighting, surrounded by various tools and equipment scattered across workbenches in the background. The scene captures their focused teamwork within a spacious area filled with machinery and cables hanging above, emphasizing the operational state of the central device being meticulously assembled or maintained.
