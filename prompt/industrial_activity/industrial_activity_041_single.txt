A man in a blue shirt stands back-facing the camera, diligently working with a large green and yellow industrial machine that emits bright orange sparks as it shapes glowing hot metal. The scene is set in a well-lit factory environment filled with various equipment; to the right of the machine, an orange control panel glows with green lights, indicating its operational state. In front of the machinery, a blue-green fan sits on the floor, likely providing ventilation amidst the intense heat generated by the forging process.
