A person in a blue jacket and white helmet is intensely welding a large cylindrical metal pipe on a workbench, with bright blue flames and numerous small orange-yellow sparks flying around. The individual is bent forward, deeply focused on the task, holding the equipment firmly while looking intently at the point of contact between the torch and the metallic surface. On the table nearby, there is a yellow-handled brush tool alongside other scattered items, all under dim workshop lighting that highlights the vivid glow of the welding process.
