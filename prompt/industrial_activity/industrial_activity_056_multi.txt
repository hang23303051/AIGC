shot2: A large blue metal machine, identified as a drill press with the brand name "FORTEC" visible on its side, is operating in an industrial setting and cutting a silver cylindrical metal workpiece clamped in a matching blue vise; it moves up and down while producing numerous small metallic shavings that fall onto the table below, where some are scattered around the base of the setup. An orange-handled white-bristled brush rests to the left of the workpiece, indicating potential use for cleaning purposes after machining. The entire assembly features black components at the top part of the tool interacting with the rounded end of the metal piece held firmly within the vice grip.
