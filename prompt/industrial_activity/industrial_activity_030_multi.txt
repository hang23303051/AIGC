shot1: A machine is printing a completed solar cell with striped electrodes, featuring black, silver, and white colors on its surface; the nozzle moves back and forth as it prints silver onto the active layer.
shot2: A gloved hand, wearing a blue glove and positioned on the left side of the frame, is seen aligning, attaching, holding, and rolling various components including black solar cells with silver and white striped electrodes in their completed state onto a machine that is printing silver for the processing of the back electrode.
shot3: A blue-gloved hand, positioned on the left side of the frame, is seen aligning, attaching, and holding a white metal component with striped electrodes onto another part in what appears to be an assembly process for solar cells.
shot5: A blue-gloved hand is seen aligning, attaching, holding, and rolling a small paint roller with silver paste onto a completed solar cell featuring striped electrodes in black, silver, and white colors.
shot6: A blue-gloved hand, positioned on the left side of the frame, is seen aligning and attaching a white printing roller with silver paste to its axis while holding it steady; in the background, there is a completed solar cell featuring black, silver, and white colors with striped electrodes patterned across its surface.
shot7: A blue-gloved hand is seen aligning, attaching, holding, and rolling a metal component on the left side of the frame while working with a completed solar cell that features black, silver, and white colors along with striped electrodes in its pattern.
