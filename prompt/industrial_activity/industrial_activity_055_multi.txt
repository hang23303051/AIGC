shot3: A person wearing yellow gloves and brown work clothes holds a hammer in their right hand, repeatedly striking a glowing red-hot piece of metal clamped on an anvil with pliers using the coarse hammer, while various workshop items like a large orange bucket, machinery, and tools are visible in the background.
shot4: A person wearing a glove holds and rotates a rough, black metal object resembling a small axe or tool with multiple protrusions; the background features various workshop equipment including an anvil, red gas cylinder, yellow container, and other tools. The scene transitions to show different angles of the same dark gray metallic item clamped onto another piece of steel on a workbench in what appears to be a garage setting filled with industrial items like air compressors and machinery parts.
shot5: A person wearing white gloves opens a large, gray industrial kiln labeled "evenheat" and "PROPHONIX," revealing an intense orange-red glow inside; the machine is situated on a black metal workbench with various tools like red-handled pliers nearby. The individual uses long tongs to remove a glowing hot piece of material from the kiln and places it into a tall cylindrical container where it ignites in bright blue flames, then carefully manipulates the burning object over the flame for further heating or treatment before transitioning to holding a knife against a spinning abrasive belt that produces visible sparks as they sharpen its edge.
