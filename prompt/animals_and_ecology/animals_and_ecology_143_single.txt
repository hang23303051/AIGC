A woman with long blonde hair, wearing a purple jacket, blue jeans, and brown boots, kneels in the snow outside a beige house. She pets a large white-gray wolf-like dog that lies on its back before sitting up to receive more attention from her. The background features turquoise and purple plastic outdoor chairs near the house, which has a glass door framed by netting or tarp covering one side, along with potted plants placed nearby. Sunlight illuminates the snowy ground, highlighting the texture of the snow and the fur of the dog as it moves slightly while being petted.
