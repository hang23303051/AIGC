A small, adult female cockatiel with a yellow-orange face, white body, and feathery texture perches on a white plastic looped perch inside a golden metal wire cage. The bird is alive, looking around while standing upright, facing forward, and occasionally hopping up and down the box beneath the perch. A brown cardboard box sits under the perch, adding to the cozy setting of the scene, which is well-lit by natural light coming from the left side.
