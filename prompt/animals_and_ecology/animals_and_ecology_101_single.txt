A black butterfly with striking orange markings on its wings hovers and perches delicately on a cluster of small white flowers, feeding from their nectar. The large green leaves in the background provide a vibrant contrast to the dark hues of the butterfly's veined wings, which are left-facing as it moves gracefully between the flower and leaf. Sunlight filters through the foliage, illuminating the intricate details of the petals and the butterfly's textured body, while rapid wing flaps create a gentle blur that highlights its dynamic motion before taking off again.
