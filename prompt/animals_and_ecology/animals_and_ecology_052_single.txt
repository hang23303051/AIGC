A hand with pink fingernails gently hovers near a lush green plant, causing several butterflies to flutter their wings in response. The scene is well-lit by natural light streaming through an opening above, highlighting the vibrant blue and brown patterns on the large butterfly's wings as it moves around the foliage. Other smaller butterflies perch or hover nearby, some facing backward while others show off their open-wings display. As the hand reaches for another leaf, more butterflies take flight, creating a dynamic interplay between the human touch and the delicate movements of the insects against the dense backdrop of broad leaves.
