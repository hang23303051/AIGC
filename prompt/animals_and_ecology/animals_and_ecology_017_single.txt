A group of white wolves is seen in a lush, green enclosure at the Toronto Zoo, with one wolf howling while lying on a large rock to the right, its mouth open wide. Several other wolves stand and move around on rocks and grassy terrain nearby, their attention focused elsewhere as they look around or interact quietly. The scene captures natural daylight filtering through dense foliage, highlighting the soft texture of the wolves' fur against the vibrant greens and purples of wildflowers scattered throughout the area.
