A beekeeper, dressed in a white protective coat and gloves, stands outdoors inspecting a beehive box filled with numerous bees. The honeycomb frames are black with hexagonal cells, densely populated by small-bodied yellow and black striped bees that crawl and hover actively across the surface. In the background, lush green foliage is visible, providing a natural setting for the hive inspection as sunlight illuminates the scene, highlighting the texture of the wax comb and the busy activity of the bees.
