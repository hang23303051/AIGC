A small fox with brown fur and a white-tipped tail cautiously peeks out from a glass door, its curious eyes scanning the tiled floor below. The scene is set at night, illuminated by soft indoor lighting that highlights the glossy surface of a red and yellow apple placed prominently in the foreground alongside a piece of pink dog food. As the fox steps down onto the warm terracotta tiles, it sniffs both items before decisively approaching the meat, which glows slightly under the light, while a blue plastic trash can sits quietly to the left against the dark background outside the open door. Text reading "Easiest decision of my life" appears briefly above the fox as it makes its choice.
