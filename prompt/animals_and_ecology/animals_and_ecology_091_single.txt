A dolphin leaps from the water, creating a splash as it arcs gracefully in the clear blue sky above the ocean. People watch the dolphin; some are standing or wading in the shallow waves near the shore, while others sit on beach chairs under the bright sunlight. The scene is lively with several individuals enjoying the sunny day at the beach, and one person sits comfortably on a green folding chair to the left.
