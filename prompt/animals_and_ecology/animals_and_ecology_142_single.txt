A large gray elephant stands on a dirt path near a green and yellow metal gate, its trunk extended over the barrier. A person in a brown uniform with a hat reaches out to touch the elephant's trunk as it rests gently against the fence. The background features clear blue skies, scattered trees, and an open field under bright sunlight. On the right side of the frame, another individual is partially visible behind the gate, while a sign reading "BHAMA LILADI" hangs prominently from the fence post.
