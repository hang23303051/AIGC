A person holds a small leaf-insect with brown and green, leaf-shaped patterns on their wrist; the insect clings to the hand, facing downward. The person wears a black sleeve, multiple silver bracelets, and has tattoos of a tree and triangle on their arm. In the background, vibrant yellow-green leaves create a natural outdoor scene under bright lighting.
