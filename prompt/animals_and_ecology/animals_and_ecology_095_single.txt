In an outdoor enclosure with a chain-link fence and stone wall, two cheetahs—one with dark spots sitting on the left side of the frame and another light-yellow-spotted one resting to the right—observe as an ocelot playfully bites and paws at a colorful ball. The scene is bathed in natural sunlight, highlighting the animals' spotted fur against the concrete ground scattered with small debris. As the vibrant green, pink, and black soccer ball rolls away, both cheetahs become active, approaching it while the third cheetah joins them, all three chasing after the moving ball across the sandy area near some logs and trees visible in the background.
