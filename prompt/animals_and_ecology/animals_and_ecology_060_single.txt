A person in a dark gray jacket gently holds a young, large kangaroo with brown and gray fur, its tall ears perked up as it looks around calmly. The kangaroo stands on grassy ground under bright sunlight, appearing alert yet relaxed while being petted by the individual whose hands are visible holding its body from behind. In the background, people walk along paths surrounded by trees, creating a serene park setting that bathes the scene in warm light. The kangaroo's head turns slightly to face left, showcasing its soft fur texture against the clear blue sky dotted with wispy clouds.
