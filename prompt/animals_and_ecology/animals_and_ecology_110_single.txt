A large male baboon with brown fur aggressively attacks a gazelle, which has black, orange, and white striped legs. The struggling gazelle attempts to escape as the baboon bites and tears at its flesh in an open grassy field under bright daylight. In another scene, set in dense green foliage, the same baboon is seen holding a small fawn by the neck while feeding on it, surrounded by thick vegetation.
