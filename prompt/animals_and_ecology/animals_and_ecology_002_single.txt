A man in a beige vest and brown shirt, holding a black hat, gently pets an elephant's trunk as it extends through a green and yellow fence. The elephant, gray with chained legs, stands calmly while the man touches its head. Nearby, another person in a tan-brown uniform observes the interaction, wearing a lanyard with a badge around their neck. A woman in an orange-yellow sari also watches from beside the fence under bright daylight, surrounded by other elephants grazing on grassy terrain dotted with trees.
