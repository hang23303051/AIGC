A large brown and white speckled owl with feathery texture flaps its wings, displaying a calm yet alert demeanor while perched on a small platform covered with green moss. The owl's yellow eyes are front-facing, looking directly at the camera as it moves closer to reveal more details of its head and beak. In the background, a green wooden wall and chain-link fence enclose the area, suggesting an outdoor enclosure under natural daylight.
