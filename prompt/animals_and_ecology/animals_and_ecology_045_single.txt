A small, brown squirrel with fluffy fur and a bushy tail is perched on a tree branch, looking alert and active as it surveys its surroundings. The squirrel climbs up the rough, textured bark of the tree trunk while occasionally glancing around, then leaps down from the branch. A new branch extends outward from the main trunk, adding to the intricate network of limbs against the blurred green forest background.
