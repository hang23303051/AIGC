Two small, adult male birds with striking red faces, black and white heads, yellow shoulders, and brown bodies are perched on either side of a cylindrical bird feeder filled with mixed seeds. The left bird is facing forward while pecking at the seed, its beak open as it looks around alertly, whereas the right bird turns slightly to face away from the camera before turning back towards the feeder. Both birds exhibit feathery textures and dotted patterns in their plumage, standing still yet ready to move or feed again. Sunlight filters through the green foliage in the background, creating a soft, natural light that highlights the vibrant colors of the birds against the blurred garden setting.
