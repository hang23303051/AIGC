A large white dolphin with a furry texture and skin material swims actively in an indoor pool, emerging from the water to approach a small yellow-orange spherical object resting on the left side of a blue platform. The background features circular windows allowing natural light to illuminate the scene, creating reflections on the wet surface of the platform. The dolphin repeatedly submerges and re-emerges while looking at and moving towards the stationary orange ball positioned near the rocky wall structure on the far left.
