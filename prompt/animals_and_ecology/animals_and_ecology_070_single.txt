Two large adult male bears, one with light-brown fur and the other with dark brown wet fur, engage in playful interaction on a grassy area. The bear with light-brown fur lies on its back, rolling playfully while looking at the darker bear, which leans over it, nuzzling and gently biting as they both display dense, solid-patterned coats. Their movements are lively and affectionate, set against a background of green grass and wire fencing under bright daylight.
