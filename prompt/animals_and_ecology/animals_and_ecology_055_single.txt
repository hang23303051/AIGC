A male lion with a dark-brown mane and light-brown coat stands aggressively, roaring while fighting another smaller female lion with a lighter tan coat. The male leads the way forward, walking through dry grass and patches of green foliage, as the female follows closely behind him to his left. Both lions display an aggressive state throughout the scene, set against a backdrop of dense green leaves and scattered logs on the ground.
