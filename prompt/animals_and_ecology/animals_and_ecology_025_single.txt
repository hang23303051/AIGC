A hand appears, gently holding a large, shiny black beetle against a rough, textured wall. The beetle moves slightly as the hand shifts its position, revealing more of its elongated body and long antennae. Sunlight casts soft shadows on the concrete surface below, highlighting the intricate details of the beetle's exoskeleton. Eventually, the beetle is placed back onto the ground, where it continues to crawl away from the palm.
