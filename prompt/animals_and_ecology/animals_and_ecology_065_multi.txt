shot3: A large hammerhead shark with a brown-gray body and smooth texture glides gracefully in the center of the frame, its head facing downward as it swims upward through clear blue water; another dark-gray to light-gray hammerhead shark moves slowly toward the right foreground while small black-and-white striped fish swim below them following their path; a medium-sized stingray with a spotted pattern lies on the sandy bottom background next to a patch of rough brown-green coral reef, contrasting with other marine life like silver fish near the top-center swimming alongside the main shark's distinct hammer-shaped head.
shot4: A large hammerhead shark with a brown-gray body and smooth texture glides gracefully upward in clear blue water, its mouth slightly open revealing sharp teeth, while two divers equipped with cameras film the scene from below; smaller silver fish swim near the shark's head, another dark-gray hammerhead moves slowly to the right facing forward, a light-brown spotted stingray rests on rippled sand in the background, and coral reefs of brown and green stand out against the sandy bottom.
shot5: A large hammerhead shark with a brown-gray body and smooth texture glides gracefully over the rippled, light-colored sand at the bottom of clear blue water, its distinct hammer-shaped head facing downward as it swims slowly in the foreground to the left, while another dark-gray hammerhead shark moves slightly behind it towards the right; small black-and-white striped fish swim below them following their movements, accompanied by other marine life including stingrays resting on the sand and coral reefs standing in the background under soft lighting.
