A large gray-brown kangaroo stands on a grassy area near a body of water, gently holding and licking a smaller baby kangaroo that clings to its side. A white bowl rests on the grass nearby, while another adult kangaroo is visible in the background among trees and bushes. The scene is bathed in natural daylight, highlighting the soft textures of the kangaroos' fur and the vibrant green grass underfoot.
