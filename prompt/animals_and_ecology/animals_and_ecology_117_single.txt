A zebra with a black and white striped body is partially submerged in brown, murky water at the riverbank, facing left. The scene shows another zebra swimming away from the camera while one lies on the sandy shore surrounded by rocks and patches of green grass. Suddenly, a crocodile clamps onto the hindquarters of the struggling lying zebra as it attempts to rise up and escape across the rocky bank under bright daylight.
