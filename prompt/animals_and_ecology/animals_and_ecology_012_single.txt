Two adult koalas, one male and one female, are perched on a tree branch in what appears to be a zoo or sanctuary. The gray-furred male is hanging from the left side of the tree, eating leaves with his back facing the camera, while the soft-textured female sits above him on the right, gently grooming her companion by nuzzling its head. Sunlight filters through the green foliage, casting dappled shadows on the ground below, which has a reddish-brown dirt surface scattered with small rocks and wooden structures. Their medium-sized bodies rest comfortably as they interact peacefully under the warm light.
