Two adult male goats with long, wooly fur—one predominantly white with a brown face and the other mostly brown—graze peacefully on a sunlit hillside. The foreground goat moves slowly across dry grass and rocks, its head lowered to nibble at sparse vegetation, while the background goat remains partially obscured by shrubs but continues feeding as well. Snow-capped mountains rise majestically in the distance under a clear blue sky, creating a serene alpine landscape where both goats are positioned left-to-center and right, respectively, with one facing forward and the other slightly turned away. Bright natural light illuminates their thick coats, highlighting the texture of their wool against the rugged terrain dotted with large boulders and leafless bushes.
