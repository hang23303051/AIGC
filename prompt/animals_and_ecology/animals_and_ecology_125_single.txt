A large, adult male sea turtle with a brown, hard shell featuring dark, net-like patterns and speckled textures glides gracefully through the clear blue water. Its flippers paddle rhythmically as it swims in an underwater coral reef teeming with various corals and rocks of green, brown, and blue hues. The healthy marine creature looks left, its head and legs visible against the vibrant background, while sunlight filters down, illuminating the scene from above.
