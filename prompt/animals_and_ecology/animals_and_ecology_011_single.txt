A medium-sized brown lizard with a speckled pattern and rough texture rests on a weathered wooden branch, facing to the right. Its body is perched steadily as it licks its lips, extending its long tongue briefly before retracting it back into its mouth. The background features lush green foliage, creating a natural habitat setting that highlights the lizard's earthy tones. Soft lighting illuminates the scene, enhancing the detailed textures of both the lizard's scales and the bark of the branch.
