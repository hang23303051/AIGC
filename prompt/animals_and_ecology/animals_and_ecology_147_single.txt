A small, adult male bird with a white-yellow-orange crest, pink feet, and orange cheek spots is perched on a yellow bar of a metal cage. The bird's feathers are smooth and feathery, displaying solid colors without distinct patterns, as it moves its head left and right while vocalizing. It appears alert and engaged, looking around the room which features a wooden cabinet and framed picture in the background. Soft indoor lighting illuminates the scene, highlighting the bird's vibrant plumage and active behavior.
