A large koala with fluffy gray fur, black nose, and white-tipped ears sits calmly among green eucalyptus leaves attached to a rough-barked brown tree trunk. Its dark eyes are alert as it feeds on the elongated green leaves, its tongue occasionally visible while chewing. The background is softly blurred, highlighting the koala's clean, well-groomed appearance in natural daylight.
