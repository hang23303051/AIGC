A large black and brown striped spider with a hairy texture sits spread out on a gray, round rock inside a terrarium. The background features an orange-brown brick-patterned synthetic wall, while the right side of the enclosure has a circular silver metal door. A small white plastic water bowl is positioned at the bottom center in front of the spider, which remains mostly still throughout the scene under dim lighting that highlights the rough textures of the walls and rocks.
