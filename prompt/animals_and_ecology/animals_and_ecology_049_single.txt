Two large penguins, with smooth black and white bodies accented by yellow necks and tails, walk side by side across a snowy landscape under a clear blue sky. The larger penguin on the left stumbles slightly as it flaps its wings to regain balance while sliding forward; both are facing away from the camera but occasionally glance around. Their synchronized walking continues until one falls onto its belly, prompting the other to stop and look back at it before resuming their path together through the bright, sunlit snow.
