A light-brown otter is curled up and resting on a rock in the foreground, its wet fur glistening under natural light. In the background, a dark-brown otter moves around curiously near some logs, while another medium-brown otter sits nearby, grooming itself with an alert posture. The scene takes place by a calm body of water, surrounded by smooth rocks and scattered wooden debris, creating a serene habitat for the otters to explore and relax.
