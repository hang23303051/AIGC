A small, adult male bird with a gray-brown-orange-black head, orange eyes, and a yellow breast is perched on a branch. Its brown wings and tail are slightly raised, while its legs grip the thin, light-colored branch firmly. The bird appears alert, calling out with its beak open, surrounded by lush green leaves and delicate pink flowers in soft natural light.
