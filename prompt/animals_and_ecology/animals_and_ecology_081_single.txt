A young adult gray bear, with dense fur and a large size, stands on its hind legs beside a red SUV parked on a forest road, curiously investigating the vehicle. The bear leans against the car door, using its front paws to touch the smooth metal surface of the red car while looking intently at it. In the background, green trees create a lush backdrop, contrasting with the brown dirt path where the bear is positioned near the edge of the asphalt road.
