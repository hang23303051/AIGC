An adult snowy owl with striking yellow eyes and a white face speckled with black spots sits protectively, its large body partially visible. Nestled against the mother is a small, gray, fuzzy chick with closed eyes and a tiny yellow beak, resting peacefully on her chest. The background is softly blurred, emphasizing the intimate bond between the two owls as they share a quiet moment in dim light. Both birds remain alert yet calm, their positions highlighting the nurturing relationship of the parent guarding her dependent offspring.
