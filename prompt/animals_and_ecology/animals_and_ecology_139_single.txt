A small hummingbird with a black head, white underparts, and a distinctive purple throat hovers in the air while drinking nectar from a red-capped container adorned with yellow flower-like petals. The bird's long, slender beak is extended into the opening as it flits between hovering and briefly perching on the edge of the cap. In the background, a lush green lawn stretches out, dotted with dry plants and framed by a brick wall, all bathed in bright daylight that highlights the vibrant colors of the scene.
