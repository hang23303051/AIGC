A person wearing a purple shirt, gray shorts, black socks, and white Adidas sneakers bends over on a paved path next to tall green grass. They hold a small golf club in one hand and gently pet a young fawn with the other, while carrying a crossbody bag slung across their back. The tiny brown-spotted fawn stands alertly among the lush vegetation, looking directly at the person as they interact closely under bright daylight.
