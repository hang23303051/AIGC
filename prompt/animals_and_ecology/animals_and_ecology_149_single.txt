A gray and white furry koala, with soft fur texture, is resting on a brown rough-textured log in a lush green forest. The adult male koala appears sleepy, lying left-facing while adjusting its position by moving its paws and tail slightly. It licks its face and sways gently as it clings to the branch, surrounded by vibrant green leaves that create a serene natural backdrop.
