A large lizard with a gray-green, scaled, and speckled body clings to a rough-textured branch in a naturalistic enclosure. Its head is facing forward, appearing alert yet calm, while its tongue occasionally flicks out. The soft, indirect lighting highlights the intricate details of its skin texture and the surrounding foliage, creating a serene atmosphere as the camera captures a close-up frontal view of the creature perched on the tree limb.
