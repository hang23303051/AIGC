In a snowy, tree-lined landscape with overcast lighting, two large adult wolves interact playfully; one wolf has gray-black fur dusted with snow on its face and stands alert in the foreground, while the other is white-furred, lying down or standing relaxed in the background. The gray-black wolf bites gently at the white wolf's neck before stepping back to look around, then moves forward towards the camera, revealing more of its fluffiness and solid color pattern. Snowflakes lightly cover their fluffy fur as they engage closely, displaying both playful biting and gentle licking between them, creating a dynamic yet serene winter scene where each wolf’s size, texture, and state are clearly visible against the wintry backdrop.
