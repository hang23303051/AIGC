A group of flamingos stands on a dirt ground, surrounded by lush green trees and palm trunks in the background. The central flamingo displays its wings wide open, revealing black primary feathers with pink edges, while other flamingos remain mostly stationary or preen themselves nearby. Most birds have long pink legs and necks, some exhibiting white bodies mixed with orange-pink plumage, creating a vibrant contrast against the earthy terrain under natural daylight.
