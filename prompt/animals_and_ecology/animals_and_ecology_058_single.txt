A brown deer with small antlers stands in a sunlit park, grazing on the short grass as it moves slowly across the field. The background features tall green trees casting long shadows under clear skies, creating a peaceful natural setting. As the deer continues to walk and graze, its head is often lowered towards the ground, searching for food among the dry patches of grass.
