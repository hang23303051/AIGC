A white cockatoo, with a soft and feathery texture, is perched on a blue and white swirled patterned pillow. The bird appears to be an adult female, actively preening itself by pecking at its own body parts such as the tail, wing, claw, eye, and even scratching under its head while facing towards the right side of the frame. A person's hand gently touches the bird near its feet, indicating interaction between the human and the animal in this cozy indoor setting where natural light filters through closed blinds in the background.
