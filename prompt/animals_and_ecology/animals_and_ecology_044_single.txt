A vibrant, multi-tiered fountain with red and gold metallic bowls cascades water from the top to the bottom in a serene garden setting. A hummingbird hovers near the uppermost spout, its iridescent feathers catching the sunlight as it drinks from the flowing water. The background is lush with green foliage, creating a peaceful atmosphere under dappled natural light. Water flows smoothly through each tier, reflecting the surrounding greenery and enhancing the tranquil scene.
