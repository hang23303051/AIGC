Two bees, one with a black and brown striped body facing left and the other right-facing, are interacting on a light wooden surface. Their antennae touch as they stand close together, their wings slightly spread. The background is blurred, showing more bees in shadowed areas, while soft natural light illuminates the scene, highlighting the texture of the wood beneath them.
