An adult gorilla with large, dark black fur cradles a small baby gorilla in her arms. The baby's tiny body is nestled against the mother's chest, its eyes closed and head resting peacefully on her arm. Both are surrounded by dense, vibrant green foliage, creating a natural backdrop of ferns and leaves. The scene exudes calmness as the mother gazes protectively at her offspring, their bond evident in the gentle way she holds the baby close to her side.
