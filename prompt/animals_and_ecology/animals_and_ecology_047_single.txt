A black-and-white panda with a round face and ears on top of its head sits in a lush, green forested area, holding a large, fresh bamboo stalk. The panda uses both paws to grip the vibrant green cylindrical plant, which has a cut end revealing white inner material, as it chews contentedly. After some time, the panda drops the partially eaten bamboo onto its lap while looking down at it curiously, surrounded by dense foliage and soft natural light filtering through the trees.
