A large, dark-brown spider with a striped pattern and smooth texture is actively moving its legs while resting in the center of a pale-skinned open palm. The hand appears clean and slightly textured, holding the spider securely as it crawls across the fingers towards the middle finger. In the background, an outdoor setting with concrete ground and some indistinct objects can be seen under natural lighting.
