A black-spotted leopard with a brown coat climbs a tree trunk, its spotted body crouching and hanging mid-air as it ascends. Emerging from the water near a small pond in a dry, earthy landscape, the same leopard runs across muddy ground, splashing slightly before continuing to move away on the dirt path surrounded by sparse green grass patches. The scene transitions smoothly between the forested background of tall trees and dense foliage to the open savanna-like terrain under natural daylight.
