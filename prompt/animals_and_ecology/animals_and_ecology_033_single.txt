A large antelope with long, curved horns stands on a grassy hillside, looking at a smaller antelope with shorter horns that is moving past. The larger antelope begins to chase the smaller one up the slope, following closely as they both navigate the uneven terrain scattered with rocks. In the background, more antelopes graze and move about in the green, sunlit landscape.
