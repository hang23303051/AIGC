A gray and white tabby cat stands outside a window, intently looking in with its ears perked and tail flicking slightly. Inside, a green parrot with a pink beak is calmly observing the cat from the windowsill, both animals appearing alert yet composed under natural daylight streaming through the glass. The background reveals a garden scene with rocks, grass, and vibrant red foliage, while small leaves occasionally fall gently around them.
