Two monkeys sit on the forest floor, one with gray fur holding a red and yellow apple while eating it. The other monkey, with brown fur, sits calmly to the right, looking at the first monkey as they eat. Sunlight filters through the trees, casting dappled light on the ground covered with dirt and small twigs. Text appears in green above them, reading "Old monkey love."
