A red Canadian Railway 147 train engine, with a solid metal pattern and large size, moves steadily from left to right along the tracks in the foreground. Attached behind it are several black Procor tanker cars, also made of metal and appearing stationary relative to the moving engine. The scene is set against a backdrop of dense green pine trees, which vary in height and texture, standing prominently in the midground. Towering snow-capped mountains rise majestically in the background, their rocky surfaces displaying shades of blue, gray, and white under soft natural lighting.
