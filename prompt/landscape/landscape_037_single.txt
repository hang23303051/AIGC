A majestic, snow-capped mountain with a smooth, dark-blue base and white summit stands prominently in the center of the frame. The sky transitions from deep blue to soft pink, orange, and yellow hues as the sun rises behind the mountain, casting warm golden light across the landscape. Fluffy white clouds drift gently on the left side, while low-lying mist hugs the valley below, creating a serene atmosphere. As the scene unfolds, the lighting shifts dramatically, highlighting the rocky texture of the mountainside and the snowy peak, which remains bathed in sunlight throughout the sequence.
