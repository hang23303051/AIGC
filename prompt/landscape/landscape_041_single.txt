A flowing river with blue and white water rushes over large, rough rocks, creating a choppy, foamy texture. Green trees line the bank under a bright sky filled with scattered clouds, while a black fence runs along the top of the grassy hill in the background. The scene is well-lit by natural daylight, highlighting the dynamic movement of the rushing water as it cascades down the rocky terrain.
