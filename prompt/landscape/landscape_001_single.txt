A cable car ascends a snow-covered mountain, its thin black cables stretching vertically from the top of the frame towards the peak. The mountainside is dotted with green trees on the snowy terrain, while dense white fog blankets the lower part of the valley below. Above the fog, a clear blue sky provides a serene backdrop, creating a striking contrast between the crisp air and the misty landscape beneath.
