The video captures a serene sunset over the ocean, where dark-gray and light-orange clouds form an irregular, scattered pattern across the sky, creating a dramatic gradient from deep blue at the top to warm orange near the horizon. Below, the sea is a deep blue with smooth waves gently rippling under the fading sunlight. As the sun sets further, its golden glow intensifies on the water's surface, casting shimmering reflections that dance along the ripples. The overall scene exudes tranquility, with the interplay of colors and textures highlighting the natural beauty of the coastal landscape as day transitions into night.
