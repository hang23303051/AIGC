A person wearing gray pants and yellow snowshoes walks on a snowy path, with water splashing around their feet. They hold a black titanium cup branded "snow peak" under a flowing stream of clear liquid from an icy surface, filling it up against a backdrop of white ice and green coniferous trees with bare branches. The scene is set in a cold outdoor environment with natural light illuminating the smooth texture of the running water over the rough, white ice, which rests atop brown tree trunks surrounded by more evergreen foliage.
