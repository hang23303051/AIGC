A small white boat gently sails on the vibrant turquoise water, positioned to the left of a grand suspension bridge that spans across the serene fjord. Lush green trees line the rocky shore beneath the bridge, while majestic mountains rise in the background, partially shrouded in soft morning mist under a bright sky with scattered clouds. The scene is bathed in natural daylight, highlighting the vivid colors of the landscape and the structural details of the bridge.
