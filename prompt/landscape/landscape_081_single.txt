A person in a red jacket and brown pants, equipped with ski poles, walks steadily along a narrow snowy ridge on a vast mountain range. The individual is looking ahead at the towering snow-covered peaks that stretch into the distance under a clear blue sky. The rugged terrain features rocky outcrops beneath layers of pristine white snow, creating a dramatic contrast against the bright sunlight illuminating the scene. As the person continues their journey across the high-altitude landscape, they leave faint tracks in the fresh snow, emphasizing the remote and challenging environment.
