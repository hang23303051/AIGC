A dynamic waterfall cascades down a white-water rocky cliff, its liquid flow creating frothy rapids as it tumbles into a clear brownish river below. Towering green trees with dense foliage form a lush canopy on both sides, their smooth leafy textures reflecting in the calm water of the stream that winds through this vibrant forest scene. The gray rocks beneath the flowing water are wet and rough, adding to the natural ruggedness of the landscape, while light filters softly through the tree canopy, illuminating the serene yet powerful movement of the water.
