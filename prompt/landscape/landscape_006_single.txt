A train moves steadily through a snowy landscape, its black and red cars gliding along the tracks that wind through dense evergreen forests blanketed in white snow. Towering, snow-covered mountains rise majestically in the background, their rugged peaks catching the soft light of an overcast sky. The scene is serene and picturesque, with the stillness of the winter forest contrasting the gentle motion of the passing train.
