Two individuals, one in a black outfit with a blue top and the other in an orange jacket paired with a black skirt, walk side by side on a narrow wooden bridge over a fast-flowing river. A large black buffalo leads them across the rickety structure, while another brown buffalo follows closely behind it. The background features majestic snow-capped mountains under a clear blue sky, with rocky shores lining the turquoise water of a distant lake. As the group progresses along the bridge, the person in the orange jacket gestures towards the path ahead, guiding their companions through the scenic yet rugged landscape.
