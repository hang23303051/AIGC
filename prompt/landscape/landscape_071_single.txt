A white van drives down a narrow, winding road flanked by towering, rugged brown rock formations under a clear blue sky. People are standing and walking on the side of the road near colorful fabric banners hanging from the left cliff face, while a red and white circular sign is visible in the foreground to the right. The sunlight casts warm golden hues on the rocky cliffs, highlighting their textured surfaces and sparse green vegetation at the base.
