A vast expanse of blue water, surrounded by rocky terrain, emits thick white steam that billows into the sky. The geyser's surface is a mix of light and dark patches, with some areas appearing almost black where the heat intensifies. Above, fluffy white clouds drift across a bright blue sky, while dense trees cover the slopes of a forested mountain in the background. To the right, a wooden bridge extends over the steaming area, with small figures standing on it, observing the natural spectacle under clear daylight conditions.
