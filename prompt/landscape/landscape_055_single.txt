A person in a red shirt, with short hair and facing left, walks into the frame from the right side of the dock at dusk, their figure silhouetted against the soft blue-gray sky. The full moon hangs low over the marina, casting a warm yellow glow on the water's surface as boats are moored along the wooden docks. Another individual wearing a green top appears briefly near the center-left, holding an object to their face before stepping out of view, while artificial lights begin to illuminate the large building behind the trees.
