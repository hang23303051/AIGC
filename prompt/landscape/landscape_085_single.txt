A powerful geyser erupts from a small pond, shooting water high into the clear blue sky before it cascades back down with a misty spray. In the foreground, a red sign with white text reads "DANGER HOT," featuring a triangular warning symbol to alert viewers of potential hazards. The scene is set in a sunny park-like area, surrounded by lush green grass, tall palm trees, and other vegetation, with distant mountains visible under a bright, cloudless sky.
