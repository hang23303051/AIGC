shot1: A man in a black shirt with "HyperKelp SPACE & SEA" on the back pulls a rope attached to a yellow buoy floating calmly in clear blue water, while standing on a boat; another person's arm is visible resting on the edge of the boat as it moves forward under sunny skies.
shot2: A man wearing a black jacket and blue jeans, carrying a red backpack with white text on the back, holds a long pole in his right hand while pointing at a yellow buoy floating in clear turquoise water; another man stands nearby observing as the boat moves forward under a partly cloudy sky towards a distant marina filled with sailboats docked along the shoreline. The camera then pans to reveal a hillside dotted with numerous houses overlooking the calm sea before returning to show both men sitting on the boat's edge.
