A person in an orange jacket, black helmet, and backpack sits on a white motorcycle with a black seat parked on a dark sandy beach. The sky is painted with vibrant blue and pink hues as the sun sets behind scattered clouds, casting a warm glow over the scene. In the distance, another cyclist wearing a blue shirt moves away from the camera along the shoreline, leaving tire tracks visible in the sand. Waves gently crash against the shore to the right, while green hills rise up on the left side of the frame, creating a picturesque coastal landscape captured by Insta360 X5.
