A large, blue-green wave with a foamy crest advances horizontally across the frame, its rough texture and breaking state creating white foam as it crashes. A small, dark figure is partially submerged in the water near the top-center, swimming just below the surface of the greenish-blue ocean. The scene captures dynamic movement under bright sunlight, highlighting the contrast between the turbulent waves and the calm areas further out to sea.
