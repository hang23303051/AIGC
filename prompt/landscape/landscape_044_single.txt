A large, radiant sun shines brightly in the center-left of the frame, casting a warm white and yellow glow across the sky. Fluffy clouds with dark-gray tops and golden-yellow undersides float irregularly throughout the lower-middle and upper-right areas, creating a soft, puffy texture against the deep blue background. Light rays emanate from the sun, illuminating the scene and highlighting the varying sizes and scattered positions of the clouds. The overall effect is a serene daytime sky filled with dynamic cloud formations and vibrant sunlight.
