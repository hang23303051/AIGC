A fast-flowing river with clear, white water rushes over large, dark gray rocks in the foreground, creating a dynamic and lively scene. Tall evergreen trees stand densely on both sides of the stream, their deep green needles contrasting with patches of brown bushes that have sparse foliage along the rocky banks. The sky is overcast, casting a soft, diffused light over the landscape, which enhances the natural textures of the moss-covered stones and the vibrant autumnal colors of the surrounding vegetation.
