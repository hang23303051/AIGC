A car drives down a long, straight road with double yellow lines and white side lines on gray asphalt, flanked by tall trees displaying green and sparse yellow leaves. The sky above is clear blue with scattered white clouds, creating a bright atmosphere as sunlight filters through the tree canopy. On both sides of the empty road, dense forests stretch into the distance, their bark textures visible under the natural light.
