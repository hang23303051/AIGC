A majestic mountain, partially snow-covered with dense green vegetation and rough textures, rises above a calm, blue lake that reflects the clear sky. The scene transitions to a serene winter landscape where tall evergreen trees, their conical shapes laden with fresh white snow, stand in a vast forest bathed in soft sunlight. A small boat glides smoothly across the water below the towering snowy peak, while later, a lone figure is seen walking through the deep, powdery snow of the tree-covered terrain, creating a peaceful contrast between summer's vibrant greens and winter's pristine whites.
