A brown female deer stands alert in a vibrant meadow, surrounded by tall green grass and colorful wildflowers—purple, yellow, and white—in full bloom. She is positioned on the right side of the frame, facing forward with her head slightly turned to look at her fawn lying peacefully beneath her left flank. The small juvenile fawn, also brown, rests calmly under its mother's protective body, nursing quietly as it lies on the ground amidst the flowers. Sunlight filters through the dense canopy of lush green trees in the background, casting a soft glow over the serene scene.
