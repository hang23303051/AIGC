A large white ship with an orange stripe and a red emblem, named "39- BERKAY," is anchored in the foreground-right of the frame on calm blue-green water. In the background, multi-story buildings display various colors like brown, red, and white, one featuring a prominent red flag with a white symbol, while another building has visible number '3'. A yellow crane stands stationary above these buildings under a partly cloudy sky filled with soft white clouds against a bright blue backdrop. The scene captures a serene harbor setting where construction activity suggests ongoing development nearby.
