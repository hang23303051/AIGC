A narrow dirt path, brown and soft underfoot, winds through a sunlit forest, flanked by lush green grass and dotted with small yellow flowers. Towering trees with large, mossy trunks stand on either side, their rough bark covered in patches of vibrant green moss. Sunlight filters through the canopy, casting dappled shadows across the trail as it meanders deeper into the woods. The scene is alive with natural beauty, where every element—from the delicate white blooms to the dense foliage—creates a serene woodland atmosphere.
