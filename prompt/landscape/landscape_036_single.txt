The sky transitions from a deep blue to soft orange and pink hues, with scattered clouds reflecting the setting sun's warm light. The sea mirrors these colors in its gentle waves, which roll onto the wet sandy beach below. Small, foamy waves crash rhythmically on the shore, creating a serene atmosphere as they reflect the vibrant sunset tones above. Clouds drift slowly across the horizon, enhancing the dynamic yet tranquil scene where the ocean meets the land under the fading daylight.
