Snow-covered evergreen trees stand prominently in the foreground, their branches heavy with fresh snow. Behind them, a dense white cloud layer blankets the lower slopes of a majestic, snow-capped mountain range under a bright blue sky dotted with scattered clouds. Snowflakes gently fall from above, adding to the serene winter landscape and enhancing the pristine whiteness of the scene. The overall lighting is soft yet clear, highlighting the crisp textures of the snow on both the trees and the distant mountains.
