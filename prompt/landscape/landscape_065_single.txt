Two people sit on a stone wall by the water, gazing at two boats floating in the calm sea under an overcast sky. A large suspension bridge spans the left side of the frame, with a red flag waving atop a hill in the distance, while more individuals walk along the pier to the left. The scene is softly lit by diffused daylight, creating a serene atmosphere as gentle ripples move across the water's surface.
