A powerful waterfall cascades down a rugged cliff, its water flowing with force over brown and gray stone. Lush green vegetation clings to the rocks at the base of the falls, adding vibrant color to the scene. The mist from the falling water creates a soft haze around the rocky face, highlighting the texture of the weathered stones under natural daylight. Water continuously streams downward, creating small rivulets that trickle along the rock surfaces before joining the main flow below.
