A serene stream flows over moss-covered rocks, creating a gentle cascade of white water. The surrounding forest is lush with vibrant green foliage, and the sunlight filters through the trees, casting dappled light on the scene. Large boulders are scattered throughout the creek, their surfaces blanketed in bright green moss, while smaller pebbles add texture to the rushing water. In the background, dense vegetation frames the tranquil setting, enhancing the sense of natural beauty and peacefulness.
