Water rushes down a rocky riverbed, its vibrant blue and turquoise hues creating a turbulent flow as it crashes over large, partially submerged gray rocks. The clear water reveals the greenish depths beneath, while frothy white foam forms where the current meets the jagged stone surfaces. Sunlight filters through, highlighting the dynamic movement and texture of the rushing stream against the solid, weathered rock formations on either side.
