A person in a blue shirt and orange helmet walks along a wooden bridge, surrounded by lush greenery and rocky cliffs. Two individuals wearing black shirts and bright orange helmets stand on the same bridge, leaning against the railing as they look to the right; one wears camo shorts while the other has short hair. The scene is well-lit with natural sunlight filtering through the trees, highlighting the vibrant moss-covered rocks and clear turquoise water flowing beneath the bridge. A man stands at the end of the bridge, facing left, taking in the dense forest scenery around him.
