The video showcases a traditional Japanese hot spring area, featuring multiple wooden platforms with glass panels supported by wooden legs in front of white buildings with black trim and various signs. Steam rises from the light-blue water of several hot spring pools surrounded by dark rocks, while people walk around the bustling background. A prominent black stone lantern stands on one of the rocky outcrops near the steaming pool, adding to the serene yet lively atmosphere under bright daylight.
