An old, naked man with a mustache and a black watch on his left wrist sits in the water at the edge of a calm lake, holding a small black device that he appears to be using to take a selfie. The serene landscape features snow-capped mountains under a partly cloudy sky, dense evergreen trees lining the shore, and patches of exposed earth around the water's edge. His arms are extended forward as he looks down at the object in his hand, while another person's arm is visible resting near the bottom right corner of the frame.
