A massive, dark-gray dust storm dominates the horizon over Phoenix on August 25, 2025, under a heavily overcast sky filled with dark-gray clouds. The large brown-gray mountain of swirling dust advances steadily across the cityscape, partially obscuring white and light-brown brick houses in the foreground while overlapping green trees and a prominent white building to the right. The scene is enveloped in an ominous atmosphere as the moving dust cloud looms large against the backdrop of distant mountains, creating a dramatic contrast between the turbulent weather and the calm residential area below.
