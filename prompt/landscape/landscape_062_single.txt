A small waterfall, with two distinct white streams flowing downward through a rugged rock gorge, cascades over brown and gray rough-textured stone. Partially melted snow patches in bright white are scattered across the rocky surface, contrasting with sparse green vegetation growing among the rocks at the base. The scene is set under natural daylight, highlighting the dynamic movement of the water as it flows steadily down the mountain slope, surrounded by the earthy tones of the terrain.
