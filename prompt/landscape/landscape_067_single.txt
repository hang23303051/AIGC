In the foreground, vibrant yellow dandelion flowers with green stems and some seed heads bloom amidst lush green grass. A delicate white butterfly perches on one of the bright yellow petals in the center-foreground, its wings folded neatly as it rests. The background features a dense field of tall, verdant wheat stalks under clear daylight, creating a vivid contrast between the wildflowers and the cultivated crop. Butterflies flit gracefully around the dandelions, adding dynamic movement to the serene meadow scene.
