The sky transitions through a stunning orange-pink-purple gradient as the sun sets, casting warm hues over the entire scene. Tall dark silhouettes of trees stand still against the vibrant backdrop, their reflections shimmering gently on the calm river below. The water flows smoothly, mirroring the dramatic colors of the sunset and creating a serene atmosphere in this tranquil forest setting.
