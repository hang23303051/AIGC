A serene forest scene features a small wooden bridge spanning a clear, shallow stream over smooth rocks. Tall green trees with dense foliage surround the area, their leaves rustling gently in the breeze, while soft light filters through the canopy, illuminating the vibrant undergrowth of ferns and shrubs. White text reading "listen to the forest:" appears on the left side of the screen, inviting viewers to immerse themselves in the tranquil sounds of nature as water flows steadily beneath the rustic bridge.
