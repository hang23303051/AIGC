A person in dark winter gear skis down a snowy slope, moving from the left side of the frame toward the center. The background features snow-covered mountains with patches of exposed rock and low-hanging clouds partially obscuring the peaks. Another individual stands still on the right side of the scene, marked by a red flag, while ski tracks crisscross the pristine white snow under an overcast sky.
