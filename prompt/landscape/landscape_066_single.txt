A lively stream of white, frothy water flows energetically over large, smooth rocks in a lush forest setting. The vibrant green bushes and tall trees surround the rushing water, creating a serene yet dynamic natural scene under soft daylight. Sunlight filters through the dense canopy, casting dappled light on the wet stones and verdant foliage, enhancing the rich textures and colors of the landscape.
