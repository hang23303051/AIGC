A group of large birds with brown-and-white feathers stands in shallow, clear water near a rocky shore. One bird is seen flying low over the lake before landing and joining the others, which are pecking at small, silver fish scattered on the wet stones. The background features a calm blue lake surrounded by green trees and distant mountains under a bright sky dotted with fluffy white clouds. Sunlight reflects off the water's surface, creating sparkling patterns that enhance the serene atmosphere as the birds move around actively searching for food.
