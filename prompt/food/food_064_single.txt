A person uses a large silver knife to slice a golden-brown, swirled flatbread with dark spots into four even pieces on a wooden rectangular cutting board. The individual holds green plastic tongs in one hand while slicing the bread with the other, revealing its crispy texture and cooked state. The background features a metallic surface, likely part of a kitchen counter, under bright lighting that highlights the details of the food and tools.
