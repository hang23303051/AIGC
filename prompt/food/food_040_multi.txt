In a modern kitchen with white cabinets and warm under-cabinet lighting, a man in a white t-shirt with tattooed arms prepares sushi on a wooden cutting board. He cuts seaweed into strips using scissors, then places the nori sheet onto a bamboo mat, spreading rice evenly across it while his hands move back and forth to ensure uniformity. The workspace is organized with various ingredients like sliced avocado, red bell peppers, green onions, pickled ginger, salmon slices, and chopped vegetables arranged on plates nearby. After adding toppings such as cucumber slices and sesame seeds, he rolls the sushi tightly within a plastic container before slicing it into pieces for serving.
