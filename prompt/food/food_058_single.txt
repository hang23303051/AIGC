A person uses tongs to turn sausages on a grill, with the meat browning and sizzling under bright lighting. A gloved hand adjusts the sausages as smoke rises from the hot grates. In the background, another individual in a camouflage jacket and white gloves continues cooking more sausages, while someone else places skewered sausages onto trays below the grill. The scene is set at a busy food stall, where various signs and menu boards are visible above the cooking area.
