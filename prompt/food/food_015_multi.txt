A person in a pink shirt and camouflage cap stands in a kitchen, holding a plastic container with red bell peppers. The background features a 'Walmart' sign, various knives on the wall, and shelves with items like mugs and books. On the counter, there are ingredients including an onion, a green jalapeño pepper, mushrooms, a bun, a knife, and a pizza topped with pepperoni slices.

The man takes out a bright red bell pepper from the container and places it on the white cutting board next to other vegetables such as a green jalapeño and sliced onions. He then finely dices the red bell pepper using a large chef's knife, which moves up and down rhythmically while the diced pieces fall onto the cutting board below.

Next, the person holds half an onion and sprinkles seasoning from a small spice container labeled 'Spice' over the partially assembled pizza, adding flavor before slicing the green jalapeño into thin rounds for further preparation.
