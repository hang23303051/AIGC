A man in a light blue shirt and black gloves pours liquid from a silver kettle onto a large, round pancake placed on a flaming metal surface, with bright orange flames rising around it. The scene is set in a dimly lit restaurant where several people are seated at tables, some taking photos or videos of the spectacle. As the liquid hits the hot pan, steam rises dramatically before settling into golden-brown crumbs sprinkled on top of the pancake. Later, another person uses a knife and spatula to cut through the now-cooked dessert, revealing stretchy melted cheese inside as they lift a slice for display against a backdrop of chandeliers and dining guests.
