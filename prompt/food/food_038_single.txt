A raw, marbled strip steak with a vibrant red color is placed in a black metal pan filled with bubbling yellow butter. The text "Tips for cooking the perfect grass fed & finished NY strip steak" appears prominently at the top center of the screen against a red background. As the steak sizzles and sears, it gradually turns brown while being basted with melted butter using a silver spoon. A pair of tongs then flips the now seared meat to ensure even cooking on all sides.
