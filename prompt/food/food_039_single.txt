A person uses a metal spatula to lift and press down on a round, white, steaming food item in a black frying pan with hot oil. The hand then holds the cooked patty, which is golden-brown and crispy on one side, while steam rises from the pan. Next, a spoon spreads a creamy sauce onto a toasted bun placed on a wire rack, followed by placing the browned patty atop the sauced bun, ready for assembly into a sandwich.
