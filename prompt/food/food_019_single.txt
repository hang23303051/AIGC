A hand reaches into a speckled black bowl, picking up raw fish fillets that are white with red spots and surrounded by green onions. The scene transitions to the frying pan where several pieces of fish sizzle in hot oil, turning golden brown as they cook. Vibrant chopped chilies (red and green), garlic slices, and black beans are added on top of the cooking fish, followed by dark soy sauce being poured over them, creating a rich, aromatic mixture under bright kitchen lighting.
