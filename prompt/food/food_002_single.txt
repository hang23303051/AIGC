A plant with dark green leaves rests on a light wooden floor, casting soft shadows under warm sunlight. A hand spreads vibrant green pesto onto slices of white bread using a spoon, while another slice of bread lies nearby and small bowls containing red ingredients are visible in the background. The scene transitions to multiple layers of pink salami being carefully placed atop the spread pesto, creating a thick stack that dominates the frame as more salami is added by hands moving deliberately over the preparation area.
