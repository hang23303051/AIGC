A close-up of a white bowl filled with fresh, red pomegranate seeds glistens under bright sunlight streaming from a window in the background. A hand squeezes green lime juice over the juicy seeds, enhancing their vibrant color and texture. Orange-red Tajin seasoning is then sprinkled generously on top, adding a spicy-sweet contrast to the fruit's natural sweetness. The scene transitions smoothly as more spices are added, inviting viewers to try different flavor combinations for an exciting culinary experience.
