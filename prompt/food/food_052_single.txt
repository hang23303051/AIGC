A variety of sushi is artfully arranged on a white rectangular plate, featuring rolls with black sesame seeds, crispy golden-brown tempura coating drizzled with orange sauce, and neatly stacked maki topped with colorful fish. The background reveals other dishes, including a bowl of noodles and condiments like wasabi and pickled ginger, all set under soft indoor lighting that highlights the vibrant colors and textures of the food.
