A single grilled steak, brown and juicy with a tender texture, rests on a red and white striped tray resembling the American flag. The scene transitions to two cooked steaks placed side by side on the same patterned tray. A hand holding a black-handled knife then slices through one of the steaks on a light brown wooden cutting board, revealing its pink interior. The sliced meat is pressed down gently, showcasing its succulent appearance against the dark juices spread on the board.
