A person holds a slice of coarse, brown bread with visible air pockets and seeds in their hands. The scene is set on a light-colored countertop where the main loaf rests on a wooden cutting board branded "Peter Cook." Another smaller slice lies nearby next to a serrated knife, while a pat of butter sits atop a glass butter dish further back. Soft lighting highlights the textures of the bread and surrounding objects, creating a warm, homely atmosphere.
