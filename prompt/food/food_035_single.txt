A hand uses a black slotted spatula to lift light-brown meatballs with green specks from a pot of boiling water on a powered-on, black electric stove branded "ielection." The medium-sized meatballs are being stirred and lifted one by one onto a white plate with a blue rim placed next to the stove. A blue ceramic bowl sits above the stovetop in the background, while red digits glow faintly on the stove's control panel under dim kitchen lighting.
