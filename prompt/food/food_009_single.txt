A human hand, with a light skin tone, holds and rotates a round bun filled with white cream inside a clear plastic container on a wooden table. The bun has a golden-brown, textured exterior, while the creamy filling is smooth and slightly glossy. Another similar bun rests in the same transparent container, which features a blue and white label on its lid. As the scene progresses, the hand splits one of the buns in half, revealing more of the thick, white filling that appears soft and rich.
