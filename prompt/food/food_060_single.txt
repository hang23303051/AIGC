A person wearing a watch picks up a package of yellow corn in plastic packaging from a market stall, with the man in a dark blue shirt standing behind it. The scene is well-lit and showcases various fresh produce like pink dragon fruits, red apples, oranges, green beans, chili peppers, melons, lemons, beets, garlic, ginger, and more vibrant vegetables arranged in black crates under colorful umbrellas. In the background, another person dressed in light-colored clothing and a white cap works at an adjacent stand filled with additional fruits and vegetables.
