Two raw steaks with red and yellow fat marbling are placed on a black grill, their surfaces glistening under bright kitchen lighting. A pair of metal tongs flips one steak to reveal its seared side adorned with distinct striped grill marks, while the other remains unflipped but similarly marked from grilling. The text "Grass Fed Beef fat is NOT WHITE" appears in white printed letters at the top left corner, emphasizing the natural color of the beef fat as it browns during cooking. Throughout the scene, the background features part of a stovetop and another pan, highlighting the active grilling process.
