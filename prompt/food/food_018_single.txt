A light-blue spatula stirs a vibrant mixture of minced garlic, diced red chili peppers, and chopped green onions in a pan with a black interior and bright red exterior. The ingredients sizzle under the heat as they are sautéed together. A wooden spoon then adds brown seasoning powder followed by a rich red sauce, transforming the contents into a glossy, aromatic base. Sliced mushrooms are added to the simmering mixture, absorbing the flavors while being coated in a savory, slightly oily glaze that glistens on their surfaces.
