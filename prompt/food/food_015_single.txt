A small black ceramic bowl containing a boiled egg and white tofu blocks sits on a wooden counter, with steam gently rising from the food. Behind the bowl, a metal tray holds several pieces of cut white potatoes, while various kitchen items are blurred in the background under warm lighting. A person wearing dark clothing moves slightly behind the scene, adding subtle motion to the otherwise still setting. The overall atmosphere is cozy and inviting, typical of a traditional Japanese restaurant or food stall.
