A person holds a clear glass under a white tap, pouring a thick, creamy beige liquid into the glass. The background is slightly blurred, with warm lighting highlighting the smooth texture of the drink as it fills the glass steadily. Next, another hand places a small red cherry and an orange slice on the rim of the filled glass, securing them with a toothpick, while the scene shifts to show the decorated beverage resting on a wooden surface. Finally, a close-up reveals the finished cocktail garnished elegantly, set against a backdrop where part of a green shirt and wristwatch are visible, suggesting a casual yet attentive preparation environment.
