A hand uses a knife to slice peeled carrots on a black cutting board, with several spice jars and an oil bottle visible in the background. The sliced carrots are then placed into a brown bowl, where olive oil is poured over them from a dark glass bottle, followed by sprinkling salt and other spices. Finally, the seasoned carrot pieces are transferred into a red and white baking dish for roasting.
