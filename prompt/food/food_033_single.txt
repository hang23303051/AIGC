A hand carefully places vibrant red and yellow tomato slices on a bed of fresh spinach leaves, which are laid out over a base covered with shredded cheese. A chef in a black uniform pours a generous amount of green sauce from a spoon onto the colorful array of tomatoes and greens using another spoon to add more sauce evenly across the dish. The scene shifts to show hands sprinkling coarse salt and finely chopped garlic over the prepared food before brushing oil around the edges for even coating. Finally, additional grated cheese is sprinkled atop the mixture as it rests inside an oven, ready to bake; later, the baked dish emerges golden-brown and crisp, held by a gloved hand next to a metal plate.
