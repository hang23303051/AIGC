A pair of hands, covered in flour, press down on a round ball of dough placed on a wooden surface. The text 'First, across...' appears prominently as the hands move horizontally to flatten the dough slightly before moving around it in a circular motion, with scattered flour visible all around. As the process continues, the text changes to '...then, around!' indicating the next step while the background remains consistent with a light-colored wood and ample flour dusting both the table and surrounding area.
