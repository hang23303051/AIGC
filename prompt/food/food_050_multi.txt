shot1: A woman wearing a white apron and pink top holds a small white bowl with yellow contents, then places it on a wooden table alongside three other similar bowls in blue cups; her hand moves to the side while gesturing towards the items before she points at one of the bowls as if explaining something, all set against a background featuring a vase with purple flowers and kitchen shelves.
shot2: A person's hand, holding a pair of black-handled scissors, carefully cuts the stem of a small purple and red flower from its green stalk over a marble surface where several light blue cups filled with yellow cake topped with white cream are arranged in two rows; each cup is then decorated with different flowers including white blossoms and other colorful petals.
