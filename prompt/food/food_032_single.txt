A woman with long, wavy red hair stands in front of a large black barbecue smoker labeled "AMC," wearing a green tank top and black shorts. She opens the lid to reveal several racks of dark, seasoned chicken legs cooking inside, emitting smoke that fills the air. The camera zooms in on the sizzling meat before shifting focus to a person stirring a thick, glossy brown barbecue sauce in a metal tray using a wooden spoon. This individual then uses another brush to apply the rich, dark sauce onto the cooked chicken pieces grilling over an open flame, ensuring they are well-coated as steam rises from the hot surface.
