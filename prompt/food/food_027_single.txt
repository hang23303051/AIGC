A person holds a white tray with three plates of food, including fish and chips, meatballs with peas and mashed potatoes, and battered items with fries and lemon. The scene transitions to the same dishes now placed on a table in front of someone wearing a light-colored sweater; cutlery is visible nearby. Text overlays highlight "AND MEATBALLS" as one dish appears, followed by another text stating that all meals cost less than $20. Close-up shots emphasize the golden-brown fried textures of the fish and batter, accompanied by vibrant green peas and creamy sauces, under natural lighting from an unseen window.
