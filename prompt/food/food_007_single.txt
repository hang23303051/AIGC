A hand holds an orange square plate containing a serving of fried rice topped with crispy meat and green vegetables, accompanied by a spoon placed on the right side. Nearby, a small white bowl filled with red sauce is visible against a blue table surface. A dark liquid is being poured into a clear plastic cup with ice cubes and a wooden straw, while in the background, containers hold vibrant red chili peppers and light green soup garnished with herbs. The scene transitions to show all items together: the main dish, the prepared drink, the condiments, and their respective bowls arranged neatly around the meal.
