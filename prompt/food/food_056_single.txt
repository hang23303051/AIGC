A hand places a white plate filled with raw, white shrimp on a table, their tails pointing upward. A black bowl is then shown containing thin, green chives and the same raw shrimp overlapping light-gray mushrooms that have yellow interiors. The scene transitions to a close-up of a ladle pouring vibrant red chili sauce over the ingredients in the bowl, followed by a stream of clear liquid being added before covering the dish with a lid. Steam rises as the contents cook, revealing plump shrimp and tender mushrooms bathed in rich, bubbling sauce garnished with finely chopped green onions and red peppers.
