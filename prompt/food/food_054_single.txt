A person pours water from a glass bowl into an Instant Pot filled with raw chicken pieces, set against a white tiled backsplash. The text 'PLACE' and 'PLACE THE CHICKEN IN THE WIDE' appear on the screen as the liquid is added. Next, chopped onions are poured into the pot over the submerged chicken, followed by more instructions displayed in orange text: 'POUR IN WATER SO THE CHICKEN IS COVERED,' accompanied by oil being drizzled onto the ingredients. Finally, various herbs and seasonings are sprinkled into the pot while someone stirs the contents with a red spatula, ensuring all components are well-mixed within the cooking vessel.
