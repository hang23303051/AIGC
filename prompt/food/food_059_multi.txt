Chopsticks gently lift shrimp from a steaming bowl of yellow custard, with steam visibly rising. A hand places a woven bamboo lid on the steamer basket above it. On a kitchen counter, hands unwrap brown parchment paper to reveal golden-brown fried chicken pieces in a black wire basket. The same bowl is later shown being drizzled with dark sauce and garnished with green onions before ice cubes are poured into a glass beside it.
