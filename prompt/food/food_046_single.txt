A person uses a spatula to place green asparagus into a black cast-iron pan over an open fire pit, surrounded by lush forest greenery. The hand then adds raw salmon fillets and sprinkles seasoning from a red-lidded container onto the fish before adjusting its position in the pan with the spatula. Bright sunlight filters through the trees, illuminating the cooking process against the natural backdrop of tall grass and dense foliage.
