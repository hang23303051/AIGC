A person in a light blue shirt pours liquid onto a sizzling, browned steak cooking in a black cast-iron skillet, with vibrant red tomatoes still on the vine visible nearby. The butter melts atop the meat as it cooks, and later, the same chef seasons the perfectly seared steak with fresh herbs from a small container. Wearing black gloves, the individual slices the rare-cooked steak into thick, juicy pieces on a wooden cutting board before arranging them neatly on a white plate for presentation.
