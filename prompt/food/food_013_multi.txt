shot4: A hand holds a sauce bottle, squeezing mayonnaise onto the top half of a bun in intricate swirls and lines; the background is slightly blurred with hints of green and purple vegetables.
shot7: A close-up of a gourmet burger with layers of melted cheese, fresh arugula, red onion rings, and a thick beef patty on a sesame seed bun is shown on a piece of brown paper, surrounded by scattered purple onion slices, green arugula leaves, and small bits of food debris; in the background, there is a partially visible bottle of mayonnaise and a spoon with some sauce residue. The text "DÉLICIEUX!" appears at the bottom center initially, then changes to "DELICIOUS!" as the camera angle slightly shifts upward, revealing more details of the shiny, golden-brown bun top and additional elements like another whole burger bun behind it, all under soft natural lighting that highlights the textures and colors vividly before transitioning to a white screen displaying various texts and icons including social media links and a subscribe button.
shot8: The video transitions to a white screen with text that changes multiple times, displaying "Proximité & PRIX BAS" in black and red letters on the first frame, followed by an orange curved line forming a smiley face logo above the word "colruyt" accompanied by smaller French phrases like "prix - qualité," social media icons for Facebook, YouTube, and Instagram labeled "Colruyt France," a pink rectangular subscribe button reading "Abonnez-vous" next to a gray bell icon, all centered around the website URL "www.colruyt.fr."
