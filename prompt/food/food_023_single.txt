A large, glossy, and juicy piece of cooked meat with a rich red-brown color is prominently displayed on a wooden surface. A person wearing black gloves and a plaid shirt carefully holds the meat while using a sharp knife to slice through it, revealing its tender, marbled interior. The gloved hand pulls a string from the meat as part of the preparation process, set against a softly lit background that highlights the texture and juiciness of the cut.
