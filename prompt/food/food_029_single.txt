A hand places a small triangular orange slice on a white plate, forming the nose of a fruit art mouse. The arrangement features four bright orange slices as ears and body parts, with long green onion strips artistically placed in the center to resemble whiskers. Two additional tiny orange triangles are added at the bottom for the tail and feet, completing the playful design under soft lighting that highlights the vibrant colors against a wooden background.
