A hand holds a multi-sectioned cooking tool with four circular compartments, which is then placed on a stovetop. Eggs are cracked into each compartment of the pan, and as they cook to perfection under bright kitchen lighting, green plants and white containers in the background add a touch of freshness. Using chopsticks, cooked eggs are carefully lifted from the pan and transferred to a blue plate, while another sequence shows yellow liquid being poured into similar sections before being skillfully flipped over with wooden chopsticks.
