shot1: A slice of yellow cake with a crumbly texture and a small strawberry on top is placed on a white plate, positioned near a window that shows parked cars outside; liquid pours from a metal teapot into a clear glass filled to the brim, creating bubbles in the amber-colored tea.
shot4: A hand holding a fork cuts into a large slice of layered cake with white cream and crumbly yellow crust, revealing its multiple layers as the strawberry on top is lifted slightly by the fork's movement; there is also a whole strawberry placed beside the cake on the plate.
