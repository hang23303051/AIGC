A man in a black shirt sits at a wooden table outdoors, holding a metal spoon and fork as he eats from a vibrant mixed dish served in a clay bowl on a wooden board. The food features layers of colorful ingredients—crumbled meat, creamy white sauce, red chili flakes, green herbs, and crispy orange strips—creating a visually appealing contrast against the dark wood table. Behind him, a building with arched windows and glass panels reflects the outdoor setting, while bright daylight illuminates the scene, highlighting the textures of the meal and the polished surface of the table.
