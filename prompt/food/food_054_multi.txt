A person wearing a black apron with "BRANDT BEEF" text pours a rich, amber-colored sauce from a stainless steel pot into a white ceramic bowl containing green onions and noodles. The individual uses metal tongs to place neatly arranged slices of marbled red meat onto the surface of the broth in the bowl, while holding a tray filled with more raw beef cuts nearby on a dark countertop. Finely chopped green onions are then sprinkled over the dish using the tongs, enhancing the presentation before it is set down for display against a neutral background under soft lighting.
