A fork lifts a portion of spaghetti, revealing the vibrant red tomato sauce and green bell pepper slices intertwined with long, white noodles. The dish is presented on a white plate, under soft lighting that highlights the glossy texture of the vegetables and the rich color of the sauce. As the fork twirls through the pasta, it showcases the well-mixed ingredients and the slightly oily sheen at the bottom of the plate.
