A person wearing a white sweater and watch holds ripe, red pomegranates on a reflective surface. They use a light-brown wooden spoon to strike the spherical fruit over a white plastic bowl, causing juice and seeds to spill into it. The background features whole and halved pomegranates in deep crimson hues, with some green pine needles adding contrast at the bottom of the frame.
