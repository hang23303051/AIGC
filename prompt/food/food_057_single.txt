A hand uses a pair of black serrated tongs to dip a slice of white bread into a clear glass bowl filled with a yellow liquid, likely an egg mixture, on a light wooden surface. The text "white bread" appears in orange at the top center during the initial frame. As the bread is fully submerged and then lifted out, it becomes soaked and slightly frothy from the liquid. A person's hands are seen placing the now-soaked bread back onto the same plate after removing the bowl containing the remaining liquid. Next, a small cast-iron skillet is placed directly onto the empty round wooden tray that previously held the glass bowl.
