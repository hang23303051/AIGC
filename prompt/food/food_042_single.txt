A clear glass bowl, medium in size and transparent with a round bottom, sits centered on a light wooden surface. White milk is poured smoothly into the empty bowl from above, creating a smooth liquid texture that fills it partially. A hand then cracks two brown eggs over the milky mixture, adding vibrant yellow yolks to the white background of the liquid. The scene transitions as someone stirs the contents gently with a spatula, blending the ingredients together under soft lighting.
