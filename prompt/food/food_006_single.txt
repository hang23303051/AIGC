Oil is poured into a black wok, where pieces of meat sizzle and release their fat. Coarse garlic, red chili peppers, soy sauce, and water are added to the hot oil in sequence, creating steam and rich aromas as they cook together. A generous amount of bean sprouts, salt, chicken powder, and oyster sauce are then introduced, filling the pan with vibrant colors and textures under bright kitchen lighting. The background features blurred greenery and warm-toned objects, enhancing the cozy cooking atmosphere.
