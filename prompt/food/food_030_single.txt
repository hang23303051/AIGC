A white bowl filled with crunchy cereal and fresh strawberry slices sits on a wooden table, accompanied by a green bottle labeled "Omega 3 Algae Oil" placed beside it. Golden honey is being poured from a glass container into the bowl of cereal, creating a glossy drizzle over the textured grains. The scene is warmly lit by two small orange candles in glass holders positioned behind the setup, casting a cozy glow that enhances the inviting atmosphere.
