Oil is poured into a black wok, creating shimmering ripples on the surface. Coarse chopped garlic and green onions are added to the hot oil, sizzling vigorously as they cook in bright light. Vibrant julienned carrots, green peppers, wood-ear mushrooms, and scrambled eggs are then stir-fried together until just tender, with various seasonings like salt, chicken essence, soy sauce, and vinegar being sprinkled over the dish for flavor. The background features blurred plants and red berries, adding a touch of color to the kitchen setting.
