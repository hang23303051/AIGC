A modern house with a gray and brown exterior, featuring large glass windows, wooden accents, and an elevated design supported by pillars stands prominently. The structure is surrounded by a well-maintained grassy lawn, a stone path leading up to the entrance, and a small tree on the right side of the walkway. A person appears briefly standing on the balcony, which has open wooden shutters revealing its interior space. The sky above is overcast with blue-gray clouds, casting soft, diffused light over the entire scene.
