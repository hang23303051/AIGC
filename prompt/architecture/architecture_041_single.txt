The video showcases the Sacred Heart Cathedral, a tall beige Gothic structure with two spires and a clock face above its central rose window, surrounded by an ornate metal fence. People walk around in front of the cathedral on a paved square under a cloudy sky, while others sit or stand near nearby buildings adorned with balconies. A woman in a crop top and pink skirt walks through the foreground holding her phone, as another person takes photos from behind their camera lens, wearing a white dress. The scene is lively with various individuals moving about, including a man walking away carrying a backpack over his shoulder, all set against the backdrop of historic architecture.
