A young woman with long hair tied back, wearing a light green shirt and dark gray pants, stands to the left of a large brown wooden cabinet. She opens the cabinet door, revealing an internal mechanism that extends into a flat folding table, which she then pulls out fully from its hidden position within the lower part of the unit. The well-lit room features beige walls and white flooring, creating a clean backdrop as she gestures towards the now-extended tabletop while another person briefly appears in the background on the right side of the frame.
