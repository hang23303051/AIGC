The camera slowly pans upward, revealing a grand hallway with polished marble floors reflecting the warm sunlight streaming through large arched windows on the left. As the view progresses, heavy golden curtains part to unveil an opulent chandelier hanging from a high dome skylight, its intricate design and numerous lit candles casting a soft glow throughout the space. Sunlight filters through the glass panes of the domed ceiling, enhancing the luxurious atmosphere created by the ornate gold moldings and elegant architectural details lining the walls. The overall scene exudes sophistication, with every element—from the gleaming floor to the majestic light fixture—contributing to a sense of timeless elegance.
