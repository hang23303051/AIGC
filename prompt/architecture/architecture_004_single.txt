The video opens with an aerial view of a grand, eclectic palace featuring white walls, a green roof adorned with red ornaments, and arched windows, set against a backdrop of lush trees and surrounding historic buildings. The text "swoja obecna formę eklektycznego pałacu" (its current form is an eclectic palace) appears in yellow and white Polish at the top, indicating the building's architectural style. As the camera pans over the city, people walk on the streets below, cars drive along the roads, and sunlight bathes the scene, highlighting the smooth texture and brick-and-stone materials of the structure. Later, the image transitions to show the same building from above, now revealing a glass roof within its rectangular shape, accompanied by the text "zyskał w efekcie przebudowy (1854-64)" (achieved as a result of renovation 1854-64), emphasizing its historical transformation during that period.
