shot1: A large construction site features a partially built structure with black steel beams and red safety netting, surrounded by multiple cranes including a yellow tall crane on the left (o1), a red tall crane on the right (o2), and a long-arm yellow crane at the top (o3). Workers in orange shirts are walking on the ground level while another worker wearing a yellow helmet is visible working from a balcony. Blue and white medium-sized parked vehicles can be seen near one of the workers below them, all under clear daylight conditions as part of an event where a crane lifts a large metal beam into place above the building framework.
shot4: A large yellow crane with a long arm is positioned at the top right, lifting and moving heavy metal beams into place on a complex steel framework structure; two smaller yellow cranes are visible in the middle left area of the frame, one holding an orange worker wearing a helmet who is working near its basket while another person walks along the ground below them next to a blue and white construction vehicle parked nearby.
shot5: A large construction site features multiple cranes, including a yellow crane on the left, a red crane to its right, and a tall yellow crane with a long arm at the top; workers in yellow helmets are seen working on balconies above while another worker in an orange shirt walks down stairs near ground-level equipment like blue and white parked vehicles, all set against concrete pillars and metal railings under overcast skies.
shot6: A large construction site features a multi-story building with exposed steel beams, where two cranes—one yellow and tall on the left (o1), another red-tall crane partially visible behind scaffolding—work in tandem; workers wearing yellow helmets are seen working from an upper balcony while others walk around below near parked blue-and-white vehicles, as one of the cranes lifts heavy equipment above the structure under overcast lighting.
