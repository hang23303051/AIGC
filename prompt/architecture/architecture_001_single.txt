The video presents a large, dilapidated building with an asymmetrical and complex design, featuring rough, weathered textures of concrete and metal. The structure stands vertically in the center, facing forward against a backdrop of a sky filled with white-gray fluffy cumulus clouds that appear to be moving horizontally above it. Below the building, there is a still body of water creating a symmetrical reflection of the gray-white facade, which has a smooth texture on its surface. A small logo reading "runway" is visible in the bottom-right corner of the frame.
