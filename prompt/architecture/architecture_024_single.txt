A person wearing a pink shirt, white pants, and a hat stands in an ornate stone doorway with intricate carvings, gazing out at the calm blue sea under bright sunlight. The scene transitions to an aerial view of a large, elaborately designed temple with a multi-tiered roof painted in shades of blue and orange, situated by the ocean during sunset. A woman dressed in a white dress walks barefoot along the sandy beach towards the same temple, leaving footprints in the tan sand as the sky glows with warm hues of orange and pink.
