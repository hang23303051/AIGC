The video begins with a view of a tall, intricately designed minaret featuring geometric patterns and green accents under a partly cloudy sky. A man in a white shirt and sunglasses stands next to a woman wearing a brown top and carrying a pink backpack; they are positioned at the base of the tower, looking up towards its detailed facade. The scene transitions to an ornate door adorned with colorful mosaic tiles and black metalwork before moving inside a grand hall where two people walk through polished marble floors illuminated by warm chandeliers, their reflections visible on the ground. Finally, a person is seen silhouetted against large arched windows with intricate lattice designs, gazing upwards as another individual walks past them outside.
