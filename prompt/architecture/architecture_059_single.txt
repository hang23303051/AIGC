A large white ferry boat, with multiple decks and a sleek design, moves slowly across the calm, brown river water. In the background, an old gothic-style building made of stone stands prominently on the opposite bank, featuring tall towers and extensive scaffolding indicating ongoing construction or renovation. The sky above is overcast with soft light reflecting off the smooth surface of the water, creating a serene atmosphere as the stationary boat glides parallel to the historic structure.
