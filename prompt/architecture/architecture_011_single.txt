A modern house with a stone and white exterior stands under an overcast sky, its large glass doors revealing a warmly lit living room furnished with a dining table and sofa. The front features a black door flanked by potted plants in brown pots on the left side, while above, a balcony with a black metal railing and glass roof extends across the top floor. As the camera slowly pans from left to right, it highlights the wet tiled driveway reflecting light, small green shrubs near the base of the walls, and additional windows showcasing more interior details.
