The video showcases a large, open-front house with blue and brown tones, featuring expansive glass windows and doors that reveal the interior. The structure is made of wood and has a prominent wooden-atrium-window-structure design, allowing natural light to flood the space inside. Inside, on the left side, there is a white-sheet bed with a black headboard positioned against the wall under a lit ceiling fan with black blades. In the center-back area, a medium-sized wooden table with a glass top sits surrounded by several matching wooden chairs with carved backrests. Outside, near the front door, a green leafy plant adds a touch of nature beside the gravel pathway leading up to the steps.
