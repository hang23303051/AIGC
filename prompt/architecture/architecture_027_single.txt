A white, large bridge with a distinctive left-facing support spans across a calm, reflective river at dusk, its surface mirroring the warm-cool gradient sky and surrounding concrete-and-glass cityscape. People walk along the bridge's path and on the adjacent shore, their figures small against the expansive urban backdrop. The scene is bathed in soft evening light, highlighting the textures of the water and buildings while creating a serene atmosphere as pedestrians move through the space.
