The video begins with a view of a long, covered corridor featuring green walls on both sides and a gray tiled floor. The arched transparent ceiling is supported by black beams, allowing natural light to filter through, creating soft shadows along the path. As the camera moves forward slowly, text appears at the bottom of the screen in white font, providing information about an exhibit related to Takahashi Iwasaki Floating Lanterns for Rokko Meets Art.
