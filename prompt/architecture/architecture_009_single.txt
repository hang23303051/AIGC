A small, well-maintained white wooden house with a hipped roof and a round window on the front is set against a lush green hillside. The porch features two empty brown wooden chairs with white cushions, surrounded by blooming purple and yellow flower beds that add vibrant color to the scene. A large leafy green tree stands behind the house, enhancing the serene rural setting under soft natural light. As the camera slowly pans around the side of the house, it reveals more windows framed in dark trim, additional garden planters filled with succulents, and a neat gravel path leading up to the entrance, all contributing to the picturesque countryside atmosphere.
