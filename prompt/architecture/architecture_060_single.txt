A large, ancient building with beige and brown stone materials stands prominently under a clear blue sky as the sun sets, casting a warm glow on its domes and four minarets. A seagull glides gracefully in the foreground, flying over the historic mosque that features Ottoman architectural style. The scene is enriched by several other birds soaring around the structure, adding dynamic movement to the tranquil evening light. In the lower part of the frame, red cushions adorn an outdoor seating area, contrasting with the earthy tones of the surrounding landscape and construction site below.
