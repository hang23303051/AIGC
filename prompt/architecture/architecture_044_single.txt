A large, reflective spherical building with a smooth, silver glass surface and a grid-like pattern stands prominently under a cloudy sky, mirroring the blue patches of the clouds and surrounding cityscape. To the left of the structure, tall trees with sparse, brown branches frame the scene, their rough textures contrasting with the sleek material of the building. A wide, gray concrete path leads directly to the entrance of the sphere, flanked by small green bushes on either side, creating a paved walkway that guides visitors toward the impressive architectural landmark. As people move around the plaza in front of the mirrored facade, some individuals are seen walking along the sidewalk or near the base of the building, adding subtle motion to the otherwise serene urban setting.
