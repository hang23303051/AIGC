A large, beige stone building with gothic architectural features, including arched windows and a gabled roof, stands under an overcast sky. The structure's intricate details are highlighted by the soft, diffused light of the cloudy day. People walk around in front of the grand building, some taking photos or observing their surroundings, while others move through the open courtyard area.
