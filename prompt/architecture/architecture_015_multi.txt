shot1: In a forested area, three people are working on constructing a large wooden A-frame structure; one person in red is standing inside the frame holding something up high, another individual in light-colored clothing stands to the right of the frame also engaged in construction work while facing away from the camera, and a third person wearing blue jeans walks towards the left side near an empty ladder. Two ladders lean against either side of the partially built triangular wood framework with visible text "WHEN THIS....." displayed prominently at the bottom center of the scene throughout their activity under natural daylight filtering through tall trees surrounding the site.
