A person in a white shirt walks past the right side of a large, ancient stone temple illuminated at night. The temple features intricate architectural details and is bathed in warm yellow light with blue accents highlighting its steps and central pillar on the left. A tall, cylindrical column stands prominently to the left, glowing with vibrant blue lighting that contrasts against the dark sky. In the background, another smaller structure can be seen near the base of the main temple stairs, adding depth to the scene.
