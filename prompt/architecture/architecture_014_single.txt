A large, gray and white stone mosque with a central dome and four minarets stands partially submerged in a flooded brown river, surrounded by lush green hills dotted with various colored houses. The water flows steadily around the mosque, which is positioned centrally against a backdrop of misty mountains and overcast skies filled with white clouds. A golden crest logo reading "YAM KAPUK" appears at the top left corner throughout the scene.
