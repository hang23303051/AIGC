A red and silver train, marked with the number 4302 and blue doors, approaches the station under a clear blue sky. The platform features a distinct red-tiled edge bordered by a yellow line, while overhead power lines stretch across the scene. In the background, utility poles and electrical equipment are visible near black buildings, adding to the industrial setting of the railway environment.
