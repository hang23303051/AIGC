A blue, red, and white bus is parked on the left side of the frame at a station with large glass windows reflecting greenery outside. The bus has "rapidKL" written on its side and displays route information for "Bukit Jalil" in front. Another yellow and red bus remains stationary to the right throughout the scene. In the background, there is a small building with a green roof surrounded by lush trees under a clear blue sky, indicating it is daytime.
