A red traffic light with a black frame and the number 691 is positioned on the left side of a concrete platform, which features smooth gray surfaces and yellow tactile paving. The railway tracks run parallel to the platform, appearing empty as they extend into the distance under bright sunlight. A large leafy tree stands in the background near some bare trees, while an orange brick building with white trim and a dark roof is visible further to the right. An orange and yellow locomotive branded "COLAS RAIL" with the ID "DR73920" approaches the station from afar, gradually entering the scene along the track.
