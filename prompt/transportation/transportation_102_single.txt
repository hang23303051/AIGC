A white and blue NFTA Metro train, marked with the number 101, approaches a snow-covered platform under a clear blue sky. The elevated structure of a bridge looms above the tracks, while modern buildings frame the scene in an urban setting. A person walks along the sidewalk parallel to the approaching train, which moves steadily on its designated tracks as it nears the station entrance.
