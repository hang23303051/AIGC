A large blue and white striped tram, marked with the number 14 and route information "zürich-tram-ag," slowly turns right on a city street under a cloudy sky. The tram's side reveals passengers visible through its windows, including a male passenger sitting in a window seat, while another similar tram is seen further back along the tracks. A yellow crane stands prominently to the left of the scene, atop a building, as various urban buildings form the backdrop, their facades reflecting soft daylight filtered through overcast clouds.
