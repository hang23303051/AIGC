A small, metallic toy train with a red, silver, and white color scheme is held up in the foreground of a subway station platform. The real train, which has blue, red, and white colors on its sides and approaches from the distance towards the camera, moves steadily along the tracks as people walk away to the left side of the frame. Bright overhead lights illuminate the clean tiled walls adorned with various advertisements, while the yellow safety line runs parallel to the track where both trains are positioned.
