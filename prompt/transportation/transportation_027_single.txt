A white truck with a blue tarp and bottles in its back waits at a red light on the left lane, while a black motorcycle with yellow accents approaches from behind. A white van is positioned to the right of the frame, also waiting at the intersection under an overcast sky. The traffic light above changes from red to yellow, signaling vehicles to prepare for movement as more cars pass through the crosswalk ahead.
