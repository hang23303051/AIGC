Cable cars, including a red-and-black gondola marked "SkyCab," glide smoothly along the cable system supported by a green metal structure. Below them, dense green forests stretch across rolling mountains, partially shrouded by a thick white misty layer that blankets the valleys. The sky above is a clear blue with scattered clouds, creating a serene backdrop for the scenic aerial journey.
