A green military helicopter, with its rotor blades spinning rapidly, hovers just above the deck of a large navy-gray ship at sea, preparing to land. The aircraft's cockpit and landing gear are clearly visible as it maintains a stable hover position in the center of the flight deck. In the background, another part of the ship is seen on the right side of the frame, while small figures can be observed standing or sitting near the left edge of the deck. Bright sunlight illuminates the scene, casting distinct shadows beneath the helicopter and highlighting the ocean beyond the vessel.
