A large black and white helicopter hovers in the snowy landscape, its rotating blades creating a mist of snow as it moves forward. A person wearing a blue jacket, black pants, gloves, and a helmet is seen adjusting their gear while holding onto the open door on the right side of the aircraft, preparing to enter or exit. The background features snow-covered mountains under a clear sky, with sunlight reflecting off the fresh powder below. As the camera zooms in, another individual inside the helicopter adjusts something near the entrance step, both figures facing towards the viewer amidst the swirling snow.
