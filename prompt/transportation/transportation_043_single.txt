A train approaches the station, moving slowly along the tracks under a cloudy sky. The platform is wet with puddles reflecting the overcast light, and trees line the background behind a fence. As the red-and-white train nears, it gradually slows down and comes to a stop at the platform edge, where its front lights are visible against the dim evening setting.
