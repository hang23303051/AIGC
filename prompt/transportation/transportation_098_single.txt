A white and blue airplane, marked with "Indian Air Force" on its fuselage and a red circular logo near the tail, taxis slowly along a runway under a clear blue sky. The aircraft's wing, featuring a gray underside and black-tipped ends, is visible in the foreground as it moves past several bright blue hangars with matching roofs to the right. A tall, slender light pole stands behind the plane, while another larger aircraft’s landing gear briefly intrudes into the frame from the top edge, indicating nearby air traffic activity.
