A red train approaches the platform, gradually revealing its green side as it passes by a silver metal fence adorned with a 'Danger No Trespassing Penalties Apply' sign. The scene is set under a clear blue sky on a sunny day, with tall trees and dry grass visible in the background to the right of the tracks. A yellow platform marked with the number '3' stands out prominently on the left foreground, while sunlight casts bright reflections on the moving train's windows.
