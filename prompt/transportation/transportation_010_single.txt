A woman in a black shirt, black shorts, white shoes, and carrying a black backpack stands on a subway platform with long hair facing right, adjusting her hair while looking at an approaching train. A man dressed in dark clothes is also present, standing nearby and observing the blue-and-white tram that arrives from the distance under dim artificial lighting. The scene captures the moment when the train approaches the station, its front display lit up as it moves along the tracks towards the camera, passing by other passengers waiting further down the platform near metal railings.
