A long, green and orange striped passenger train moves steadily forward on a rusted metal bridge with stone supports, surrounded by lush, tropical vegetation under natural daylight. The top-down camera angle captures the arched structure of the old bridge as the train progresses from one end to the other. A person in dark clothing stands still on the track near the beginning of the bridge, facing away from the camera. The scene is vibrant with dense green foliage enveloping the area around the bridge, creating a serene yet dynamic atmosphere.
