A white and green train, marked with "RailClinic" on its front, moves steadily along a curved metal rail track surrounded by small gray gravel stones. The dense green foliage of trees lines the background, creating a lush forested setting under soft natural light. A black post with a white number '3' sign stands prominently in the foreground to the left of the approaching train. As the train advances forward, it reveals more details of its smooth metallic surface and distinct striped pattern, while the surrounding environment remains consistent throughout the scene.
