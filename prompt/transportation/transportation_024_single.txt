A large, white and blue bus is parked on the side of a wet road, with its front facing forward. The bus features red accents and displays route information in multiple languages on a sign near the windshield. To the left of the bus, several black motorcycles are neatly parked on a grassy area adjacent to a staircase leading up to a modern building complex. Overcast lighting suggests recent rain, enhancing the reflective sheen on the pavement and creating a calm urban atmosphere.
