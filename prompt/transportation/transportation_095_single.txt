An orange utility vehicle, branded with "atpg" and "Mercedes Actros," moves steadily along railway tracks equipped with sweeping brushes that clean the rails. The truck is seen from various angles as it progresses forward under a clear sky during what appears to be early evening or late afternoon, given the soft lighting. In the background, multi-story residential buildings line the street, while overhead electric wires for trams are visible above the track. As the camera zooms in on the front of the truck, more details emerge, such as its large black tires, silver exhaust pipe, and mechanical components beneath the chassis, all contributing to the functionality of this specialized cleaning machine.
