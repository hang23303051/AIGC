A large, white train with orange and red stripes moves smoothly along a curved railway track through a lush, green landscape. The train features the "KAI" logo on its side, indicating it is part of Indonesia's state-owned rail company, and has multiple carriages marked with numbers like "K4." Tall trees line the left side of the tracks, while dense grass covers the right embankment under bright daylight. As the train travels to the right-facing direction, its doors are closed, and power lines run parallel above, enhancing the sense of motion in this serene countryside setting.
