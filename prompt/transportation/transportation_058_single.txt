A train, marked with the "South Western Railway" logo in blue and black on its white exterior, approaches and arrives at a platform under a clear sky. The railway track stretches into the distance, flanked by lush green trees that line both sides of the station, creating a serene backdrop. As the camera pans to the right, it captures the full length of the stationary train along the yellow tactile paving edge of the platform, emphasizing the bright sunlight illuminating the scene.
