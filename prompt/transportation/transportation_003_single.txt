A long freight train, composed of various large metal containers in black, blue, gray, and white colors, moves steadily along the tracks at dusk. The containers display distinct logos such as "NORTHLINE," "PRIMARY CONNECT," and "LINFOX," with some featuring solid patterns or text designs. To the left, an empty brick platform with a yellow line runs parallel to the track, while green leafy trees stand behind the power lines that stretch across the scene. Overhead electric wires are active, casting subtle shadows under the dimming sky, creating a calm yet industrious atmosphere as the train passes by from left to right.
