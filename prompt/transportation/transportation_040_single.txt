A woman in a pink coat with long black hair is seen boarding a yellow and black bus, holding a white bag as she leans forward to enter the vehicle. The bus features printed text including "Causeway Link" and an advertisement for Jamal Ferdinand Riah, along with the number "BOR 7051." A red car bearing the same license plate, "BOR 7051," is parked next to the bus on the right side of the frame. In the background, other vehicles like motorcycles and cars pass by under bright daylight conditions, indicating a busy urban setting.
