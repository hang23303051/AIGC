A white truck and a gray SUV drive on a highway under a clear blue sky, with the truck slightly left of the SUV. The road is flanked by snow-covered fields and residential houses in the distance, while other vehicles are visible further ahead near an overpass structure. Sunlight illuminates the scene, casting soft shadows beneath the vehicles as they move steadily forward along the multi-lane roadway.
