A large, white and black articulated bus with dark ribbons between its sections is parked along the right side of a bustling city street. To the left of the bus, a small bicycle frame holds a colorful signboard near some green trees lining the road. The background features tall historical buildings in beige stone with balconies and gabled roofs, alongside a modern glass building on the far left under a partly cloudy sky. Vehicles move down the street as part of an active urban environment.
