A dark-blue and yellow train, marked with "GB Railfreight" and "Arlington Fleet Services," approaches the platform under a cloudy sky. The camera pans slightly to the right as the train passes by, revealing its maroon engine and green freight cars labeled "Arlington Fleet Services." The station features concrete platforms, white benches, lamp posts, fences, and bare trees in the background, all set against an overcast atmosphere that casts a muted light over the scene.
