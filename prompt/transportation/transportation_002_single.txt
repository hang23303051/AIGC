A man in a gray jacket and white shirt sits inside a cable car, gazing out the window at a rugged coastal landscape with rocky cliffs and calm waters under a clear sky. Another man, wearing a blue mask and purple jacket, enters and sits beside him on a light green bench; both appear to be engaged in conversation as they look outside together. The interior of the cable car features various safety signs, including one from Cork County Council about safe working load limits, and bags labeled "RED MILLS FRACTION" are visible near the seated men. Natural daylight illuminates the scene, highlighting the textures of the materials within the cabin and the scenic view beyond.
