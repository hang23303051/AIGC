A large city bus, branded with "rapidKL" and featuring a white, blue, and red color scheme, is parked at a dimly lit bus stop under an overpass. The bus displays the text "Menghubungkan-Kita-Semua," indicating its public transportation service in Kuala Lumpur. Its side windows reveal yellow handrails inside, while various signs and symbols are visible on the exterior walls. As another similar bus passes by, both vehicles move along a street lined with urban infrastructure, including metal fencing and illuminated buildings, creating a bustling nighttime scene.
