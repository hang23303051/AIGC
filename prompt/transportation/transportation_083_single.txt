A double-decker bus, adorned with an advertisement for COS and displaying the route number 159, drives down a bustling street under a clear blue sky. British flags hang prominently above the road, adding a festive touch to the urban scene. People walk along the sidewalk in front of large stone buildings with arched windows and balconies, while other vehicles move alongside the bus. The word "STOP" is painted on the asphalt near the curb, indicating traffic regulations as pedestrians navigate the area beneath bright daylight.
