A sleek, metallic train with a red top, silver body, and blue doors passes by an empty brick-paved platform at sunset, its yellow seat interiors visible through the windows. The station is quiet, featuring overhead electric wires and distant streetlights under a clear sky. Passengers are seated inside, their reflections seen in the glass as the train travels smoothly along the track adjacent to the platform.
