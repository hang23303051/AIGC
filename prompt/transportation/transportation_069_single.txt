A tram, painted in a light brown hue with dark windows, moves steadily along the tracks at night, its interior lights casting a warm glow. The street is wet, reflecting the green traffic lights and the illuminated signs of surrounding buildings, which include modern glass facades and older brick structures adorned with purple lighting accents. A lone pedestrian walks on the sidewalk to the left of the tram, while another person crosses near the center-left as the train passes by, leaving empty tracks behind it against the backdrop of city lights.
