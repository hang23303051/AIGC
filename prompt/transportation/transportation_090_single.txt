A woman in a white tank top, brown shorts, and carrying a gray shoulder bag stands on the sidewalk clapping her hands as a red trolley with blue and white accents passes by. The trolley prominently displays "LUCA FALONI" at the top, along with advertisements for Luca Faloni's brand, including text like "proudly made in Italy," "new york | miami | zurich," and an invitation to "shop online at lucafaloni.com." A man dressed in black walks past holding a white umbrella under bright sunlight, while another person is visible inside the moving trolley. In the background, elegant multi-story buildings line the street, featuring large windows and balconies, creating a lively urban atmosphere.
