A yellow tram, adorned with a black, blue, and red triangle pattern along its side, is parked at a station platform. The number "111" is prominently displayed in red on the front of the tram, which also features text such as "GLENELG" and "MAGELBY SQUARE" on its window, indicating its route destinations. A large advertisement for ACAP University College promoting job qualifications wraps around the rear section of the tram, while the Translink logo is visible near the door. Overhead wires are seen above the tram, suggesting it is an electric vehicle, and tall buildings line the background under a cloudy sky.
