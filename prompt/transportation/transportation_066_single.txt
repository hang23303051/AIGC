A blue, orange, and white striped train with a right-facing front window marked "1007" approaches the station under a bright sky, entering from the left. People in black clothes stand upright on the platform behind a smooth, metal-and-plastic picket fence painted blue and white, waiting for the arriving vehicle. The scene is set against a backdrop of tall glass buildings reflecting sunlight, while the entire area beneath the sleek, metallic ceiling structure remains well-lit by natural light streaming through gaps above. As the train stops at the platform, passengers board before its doors close smoothly, allowing the engine to pull it away along the tracks below the covered walkway.
