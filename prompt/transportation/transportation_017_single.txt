A white and red train, marked with the "KAI" logo on its front engine, moves steadily along a curved brown railway track. The locomotive pulls several silver cylindrical tank cars behind it, all traveling smoothly through a lush green landscape dominated by dense vegetation covering rolling hillsides. Bright daylight illuminates the scene, highlighting the solid colors and metallic textures of the train components against the vibrant natural backdrop. The railway is equipped with signals at intervals, guiding the train's path as it progresses forward in this verdant environment.
