A red and blue train with multiple cars approaches the platform, moving steadily along the tracks under a wooden canopy. The station features yellow tactile paving on the ground and clear "STAND BEHIND THE LINE" text painted in white near the edge of the platform. A person wearing a purple shirt, beige shorts, white socks, and black shoes stands quietly on the right side of the platform as the train arrives at Oakland Station. Sunlight casts shadows across the scene, highlighting the clean lines of the modern infrastructure.
