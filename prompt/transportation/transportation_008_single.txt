A cyclist, wearing black gloves, rides a bicycle with a black handlebar featuring a blue-tinted rearview mirror. The scene is set at an intersection under overcast skies, where the traffic light above turns red, causing the rider to stop near a brown brick building labeled "Village Hall." As the light changes to green, the bike moves forward through the crosswalk, passing parked cars and trees in the background while continuing down the road past an ARCO gas station sign.
