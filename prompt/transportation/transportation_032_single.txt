A yellow and orange striped trolley, marked with the number N2 436, moves steadily along an elevated track in front of a large beige building with multiple balconies. A person wearing a pink shirt sits upright on the left side of the platform below the track, while another individual in a white shirt stands leaning slightly to the right near the edge of the frame. The scene is bathed in bright sunlight, casting clear shadows under the green metal bridge structure that supports the tracks, which features ornate detailing at its base.
