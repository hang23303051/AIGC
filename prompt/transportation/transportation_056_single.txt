A red and white train with a distinctive front window approaches the platform, which features a blue roof and yellow-tiled edge. A person in an orange vest and black pants stands on the right side of the platform, facing the arriving train under a partly cloudy sky. The railway has multiple tracks between platforms, and signs displaying "NOVE ZA" are visible above the sheltered area. As the train arrives at the station, it moves steadily along the track towards the waiting passengers.
