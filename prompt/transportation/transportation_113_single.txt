A man in a black shirt stands outside, observing the light-green sedan with 5-spoke wheels and yellow license plate E780GEV as it moves slowly through the showroom. The car's driver is seated inside, wearing a gray jacket, while another person sits at a desk near large windows that let in natural light. Inside the spacious dealership, other classic cars are displayed under bright overhead lights, creating a clean and modern atmosphere.
