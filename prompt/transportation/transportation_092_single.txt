A green and yellow tram, marked with the number 306, slowly approaches a station platform under warm sunlight. The scene is set on brick tracks adjacent to a busy road where white cars pass by in both directions. People are visible walking along the elevated walkway beside the track, while shadows of overhead structures stretch across the ground.
