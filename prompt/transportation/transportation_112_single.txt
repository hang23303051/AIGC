A bright green semi-truck, branded with "FAW" and the model number "M7," backs out of a pink garage onto a wet concrete ramp. The truck's cab features bold black stripes and printed text indicating its total weight (35000kg) and axle distance (4000/1300mm). As it moves forward slowly on the rain-soaked ground, another silver-gray semi-truck remains parked inside the same building in the background. Trees without leaves line the overcast sky above, while other vehicles are visible further down the lot as the vibrant green truck drives away from the scene.
