A white car approaches a traffic light on a sunny day, with clear blue skies and green trees lining the road. The red traffic light is visible overhead as the blue car in front comes to a stop at the intersection. After waiting for the signal, the cars begin to move forward when the lights turn yellow, continuing down the straight, tree-lined street under bright sunlight.
