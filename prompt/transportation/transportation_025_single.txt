A large beige city bus with blue and red accents, marked "rapidKL" on its side, is parked at a station under an overpass. The rear of the bus features striped taillights and zigzag reflectors in yellow and red, along with route numbers 80 and 90 displayed prominently near the back window. A black car is visible to the right of the bus, while trees can be seen faintly in the background through the windows. Overhead signs indicate it is Platform D, suggesting this is a public transport hub during daylight hours.
