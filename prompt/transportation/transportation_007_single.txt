Cable cars, some with "Sunworld" and "Bakau Hills" printed in red on their fronts, move steadily along the cable system against a backdrop of lush green mountains under a clear blue sky. The gondolas display various color schemes, including white bodies with red tops or black trims, while one distinct red gondola features a yellow circle pattern. As the scene unfolds, several cables stretch across the frame, supporting multiple moving vehicles that glide smoothly through the dense forested landscape below. Sunlight filters through the trees, illuminating the vibrant foliage and highlighting the serene beauty of the mountainous terrain as buildings are faintly visible atop distant hills.
