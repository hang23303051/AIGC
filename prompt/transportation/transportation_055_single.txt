A red and blue train engine, marked with the number 196 and an Amtrak logo, moves forward on a snowy track at dawn, its front partially visible. Following it, another dark-colored locomotive numbered 345, also featuring stripes and the Amtrak emblem, pushes through the snow-covered landscape. Behind these engines, several silver passenger cars adorned with horizontal red and blue stripes pass by, their windows reflecting the soft morning light as they continue along the tracks bordered by bare trees and low snowbanks under a clear sky transitioning from deep orange to pale blue.
