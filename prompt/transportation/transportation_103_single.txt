A man with curly dark hair, wearing a gray shirt, is sitting on a moving trolley, looking forward at the street ahead. The brown trolley, marked with "Van Ness Av. California 58 Market Street," travels along tracks flanked by cars and pedestrians under a clear blue sky. To the left, a red-brick building stands prominently beside green street signs, while tall modern skyscrapers rise in the background, creating an urban cityscape bathed in bright sunlight.
