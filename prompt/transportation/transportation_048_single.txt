A man in a red and blue striped jacket, black hat, and backpack stands on a snow-dusted sidewalk next to a beige apartment building. He is positioned near a pedestrian crossing sign as cars pass by on the adjacent road under a partly cloudy sky with warm sunlight. The person appears to be walking forward slowly while maintaining a relaxed posture with hands clasped together.
