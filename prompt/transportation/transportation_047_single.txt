A white bus with a yellow stripe and the number "1868" on its side drives down a city street, displaying "9 CITY POINT" on its front digital sign. A gray SUV is partially visible in the foreground as the bus moves past historic stone buildings adorned with multiple American flags under an overcast sky. The scene shifts to show the bus from behind, revealing colorful advertisements along its lower half, while tall modern skyscrapers loom in the background against a cloudy horizon. Several black cars are parked or moving near crosswalks, adding to the urban atmosphere of the busy intersection.
