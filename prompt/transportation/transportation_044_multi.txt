shot1: A small helicopter, featuring a red and white body with gray accents and purple variants in some frames (N753MX), is either flying or hovering over various backgrounds including grassy fields and wooded areas; it has rotor blades rotating rapidly, landing skids visible on the ground when stationary, and an engine compartment shown up close. Inside the cockpit of this aircraft sits a male pilot wearing a headset and light-colored shirt, who appears to be controlling the flight by gripping throttle levers while seated comfortably within the open-air cabin.
shot2: A person, likely male and wearing a dark flight suit with light-colored pants, is gripping the control stick of a small helicopter that appears to be in-flight or hovering above a grassy field; the individual's hands are visible holding the black throttle lever with green accents on its top right side while their legs rest inside the cockpit area which features white panels and various controls including buttons labeled "NEL" and "MASSIMO"; another view shows an external shot of the same purple-and-black helicopter flying low over vibrant green grass under a clear blue sky.
