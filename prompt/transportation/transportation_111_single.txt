A train, composed of multiple gray and white hopper cars adorned with graffiti patterns and weathered textures, moves steadily along the tracks beneath a large concrete overpass. The first car prominently displays the "CP Rail" logo, an "S00" number, and additional text in blue paint, while subsequent cars feature similar cylindrical shapes and solid designs. As the train progresses from left to right, it reveals more freight cars marked with rust stains and industrial markings under diffused daylight, creating soft shadows on the gravel-covered ground below.
