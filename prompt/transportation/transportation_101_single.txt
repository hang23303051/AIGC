A man in a yellow safety vest, black pants, and green boots walks along a red-brick pathway towards the camera, looking to his right at a blue train with yellow carriages that is emitting smoke as it moves slowly on tracks behind a metallic fence. A prominent stop sign stands near him alongside another smaller sign reading "STOP LOOK LISTEN THINK" against a backdrop of overcast skies and a gray building with a green roof. The scene includes additional signs: one indicating an emergency assembly area next to a small wooden structure bearing logos for Rotary Club and Crompton's pay cash service, all set under diffused daylight.
