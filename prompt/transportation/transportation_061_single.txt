The video shows a subway train door with two windows, one of which displays a colorful advertisement featuring a large, red, cartoon-like animal resembling a cow on the left side, while the other window reveals part of the station platform. A metallic, perforated bench is visible through the right window as it moves along the track. The scene transitions to show more details of the station interior and another view of the same animated character in different poses within the ad. As the doors open, various elements such as signs indicating no entry after closing and route maps are seen above the doors, all under consistent artificial lighting typical of an underground setting.
