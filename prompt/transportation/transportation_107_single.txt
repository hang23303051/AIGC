A car drives down a street flanked by multi-story residential buildings in pastel colors, with the overcast sky casting a soft light on the scene. The vehicle passes a large white truck moving parallel to it and several other cars traveling in the opposite direction, while trees line the sidewalks and bus stops are visible at intervals. As the journey continues, traffic lights come into view ahead, signaling an intersection where more vehicles approach from different directions, maintaining steady flow under the muted daylight.
