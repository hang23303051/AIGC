A green and blue bus with a flower pattern, branded "GOKL" and marked "go-kl-electric," is parked in a transportation hub. The vehicle's license plate reads "VJJ 3307." To the right of the bus, there is a red wall with metal railings and yellow-black pavement markings, typical of a public transport area. A blue sign indicating "Platform A3-A5" hangs above the platform, which features black, red, and yellow elements along with shiny metal railings. As the camera moves forward past the front side of the bus, it reveals more of the station’s infrastructure, including additional signs and distant structures under an overpass.
