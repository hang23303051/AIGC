A white bus with black tinted windows and the number 1253 is stopped at a traffic light, its side reflecting nearby buildings under an overcast sky. The camera shifts to show another similar bus parked on tracks beside a utility box marked "NO ENTRY," featuring yellow doors and red stripes along its body. A third bus, predominantly white with colorful accents including blue, pink, and orange patterns, also displays the number 1253 as it moves away from the intersection, revealing advertisements for 'Kinder' products on its rear. The scene captures urban infrastructure, such as power lines and street signs, framing the buses in motion or stationary within a city environment.
