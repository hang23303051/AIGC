A woman in a blue and black striped leotard, with her hair tied in a bun using a purple headband, stands on a gym mat preparing for a routine. She raises her arms outstretched before bending forward to run across the floor towards a padded area where she performs a handstand jump, balancing skillfully while others watch from the background. The scene is set in a well-lit gymnastics facility with lockers adorned with colorful decorations and papers pinned on a bulletin board behind her. A person dressed in a gray jacket records the performance with a phone, capturing the dynamic movements of the main gymnast as she executes various poses and actions throughout the sequence.
