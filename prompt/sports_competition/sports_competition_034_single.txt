A woman in a yellow uniform with "WA" on the front dances energetically, her arms moving rhythmically. Other women join her; one has "JAMAICA" written vertically on her shorts and another wears a jersey with "C" visible from the back. The team members are all dressed in matching black and yellow uniforms featuring Puma logos and tiger stripe patterns, dancing together under bright indoor lighting at what appears to be a sports event, as indicated by the "BIRMINGHAM 2022" text in the background.
