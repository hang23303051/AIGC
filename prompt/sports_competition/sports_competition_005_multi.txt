Two fencers in white protective gear and masks lunge at each other on a red piste, with the scoreboard showing Italy 26 points to South Korea's 35. The Italian fencer lunges forward aggressively while the Korean fencer parries back defensively under dim blue lighting, creating a dramatic contrast against the dark background. After a point is scored, the winning fencer raises their arm triumphantly as the referee signals approval; another match follows where two more fencers face off, one executing a low parry that results in a successful hit indicated by green lights above them. A man in a black suit stands behind the piste, observing closely amidst the competitive atmosphere of an indoor fencing arena adorned with sponsor banners like "REWE" and "QIAODAN."
