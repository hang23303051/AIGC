A person wearing a dark blue jacket, light gray hoodie, white sweatpants, and white sneakers with black stripes is holding a field hockey stick on a green artificial turf field during sunset. The background features trees without leaves, tall metal fencing, banners displaying text like 'JUMBOHOCKEY' and 'ALTID VASTE LAGE PRUIZEN,' and distant buildings under a sky filled with soft pink and orange hues from the setting sun. Other individuals are also present in the distance, engaging in similar activities or preparing equipment near scattered white balls across the field.
