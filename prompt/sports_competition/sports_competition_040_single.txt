A basketball game unfolds in a packed arena, with players from the Los Angeles Clippers (LAC) and Denver Nuggets (DEN) competing intensely. The scoreboard shows LAC trailing DEN 98-98 in overtime, as indicated by the "OT" on the display. A player in a blue jersey dribbles towards the basket while being closely guarded by red-jerseyed defenders; teammates run down the court to support their play. The ball is passed around among several players before it goes through the hoop for a score, eliciting cheers from the crowd under bright stadium lighting.
