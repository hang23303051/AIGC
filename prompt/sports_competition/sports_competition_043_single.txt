Two female athletes are competing in a hurdles race on a blue track, with the leading athlete wearing number 4 and sporting orange shoes. The second athlete is slightly behind her to the left, dressed in black shorts. A large banner displaying "VINCO" and other text stands prominently near the finish line area, while empty blue stadium seats fill the background under bright daylight.
