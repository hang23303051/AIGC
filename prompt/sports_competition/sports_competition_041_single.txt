In a handball match, players in red and green jerseys are actively engaged on a blue court with "DAIKIN" advertisements visible. A player in a red jersey (number 19) jumps to catch the ball while being closely guarded by multiple opponents in green uniforms; one of the defenders is wearing number 7. The action intensifies as another red player attempts a shot towards the goal, where a goalkeeper in a blue uniform prepares to block it.
