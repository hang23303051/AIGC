A female tennis player, dressed in a white tank top and bright pink skirt with braided hair tied back by a white headband, is actively engaged in playing on a blue hard court. She swings her racket powerfully to hit the yellow tennis ball forward under clear daylight conditions. The background features a blue wall displaying "J.P. Morgan" and "US Open" logos, while a black bird sits perched on the net behind her.
