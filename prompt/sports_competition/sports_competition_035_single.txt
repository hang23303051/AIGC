A female gymnast, wearing a sparkly black and green onesie with her hair in a bun, runs down a red mat inside a well-lit gymnasium. She leaps onto a springboard, performing acrobatic flips mid-air before landing on a blue padded surface, raising her arms triumphantly as she stands up to walk away. The background features various colorful gymnastics equipment, including mats, blocks, and trampolines, under bright overhead lighting.
