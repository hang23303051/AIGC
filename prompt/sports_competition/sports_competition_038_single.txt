A shirtless man in black shorts performs various speed training exercises on a red and green mat inside a gym, with wooden benches and equipment visible in the background. He pushes an orange medicine ball forward while maintaining a plank position, then jumps over it to land quickly back on his feet. The text 'Judo Speed Training' is displayed at the top of the screen throughout the video. In one scene, he grabs onto a padded dummy lying on the floor, demonstrating agility and strength as part of his rigorous routine.
