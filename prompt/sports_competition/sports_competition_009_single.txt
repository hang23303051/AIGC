A male athlete in a blue and red USA uniform, wearing bright yellow shoes, prepares to throw a javelin on a track field. The text "What a technique 😊 full weight body" appears at the top of the screen as he runs down the reddish-brown track with determination. He releases the javelin mid-stride, his arms extended backward for balance, while photographers and officials observe from behind barriers adorned with 'ASICS' and 'Tokyo 2020' branding. The background features various equipment, including cameras, cones, tents, and benches, under clear daylight conditions.
