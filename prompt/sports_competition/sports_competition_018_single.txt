A gymnast, wearing a black top with the number "2" and gray shorts, performs a handstand on a blue mat in an indoor gymnasium. She transitions from the handstand into a series of flips but eventually falls to the mat before sitting up and standing again. Her coach, dressed in dark clothing, stands nearby observing her performance under bright overhead lighting, with empty bleachers visible in the background. The scene captures the dynamic movement and effort involved in the routine, set against the structured environment of a competitive venue.
