A man in a black wetsuit, with a bald head, is skillfully paddling and then lying prone on a small red and white plastic surfboard. He rides the crest of a large, blue wave that is breaking powerfully around him, creating frothy white water as it crashes down. The overcast sky casts a muted light over the scene, while a distant bridge adorned with lanterns looms faintly in the background, adding depth to the coastal setting.
