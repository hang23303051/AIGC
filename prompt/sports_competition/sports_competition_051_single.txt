In a brightly lit indoor sports arena, players in white and blue jerseys (numbers 7 and 99) are positioned mid-court on the right side, with player 7 standing back-facing while number 99 prepares to pass. A player in a red jersey (number 5) crouches defensively on the left side of the court, facing forward. The text "Gooooool 🔥" appears at the bottom throughout, indicating excitement as one team actively passes and runs towards the goal area where another goalkeeper in black stands ready near yellow seats.
