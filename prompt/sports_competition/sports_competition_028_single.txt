A skier, dressed in a white and black jacket with red pants, soars through the air against a clear blue sky, performing an impressive aerial trick. A person wearing a blue patterned jacket captures the moment on camera from below, while another individual stands near a large snow structure marked with "Intermountain Healthcare" banners for Deer Valley events 4 and 5. The snowy landscape is dotted with evergreen trees in the background, and spectators are gathered along the course, watching intently as the skier lands smoothly back on the snow-covered slope after executing multiple flips and spins high above.
