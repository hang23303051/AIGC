A field hockey player, dressed in a black tank top with "PHOENIX" written on it, green shorts, white knee-high socks, and pink shoes, stands on a bright blue artificial turf under clear daylight. He skillfully juggles a white ball using a black-and-white field hockey stick, demonstrating control as the ball bounces off the ground before he catches it mid-air to continue juggling. The background features red stadium seating adorned with various sponsor banners, including "#HEROHIL," flags from different countries flying atop poles, and distant spectators walking across the field.
