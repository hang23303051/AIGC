A person wearing white and blue sports attire, with the word "CZECHIA" visible on their shirt, holds a long, thin, multi-colored javelin while running on a red running track marked with white lines. The individual is seen in various stages of preparation: holding the javelin above their head, then lowering it as they begin to run forward, eventually launching the javelin into the air before walking away from the throwing area. Text overlays indicate this is a warm-up technique for an athlete whose personal best distance is 90.88 meters, representing the Czechia country flag.
