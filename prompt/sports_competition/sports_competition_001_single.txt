An athlete in a white top, blue shorts, and bright yellow shoes runs down a red track with multiple lanes marked by white lines. He holds a javelin above his head as he sprints forward under the clear daylight, passing various advertisements like "SONY" and "HAWK-EYE" on large banners along the stands. The background features spectators seated behind purple barriers, some standing or walking around, while other athletes wait near their equipment at the throwing area. As he releases the javelin mid-stride, it soars through the air towards a grassy field where several people are positioned to observe its flight path from different angles.
