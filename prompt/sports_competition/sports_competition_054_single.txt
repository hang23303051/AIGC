A young woman, dressed in a flowing white traditional outfit with long sleeves and wide-leg pants, performs graceful dance movements barefoot on a stone-paved courtyard. The background features an ancient building with black tiled roofs, brown wooden doors, and gray brick walls, framed by lush green trees under soft natural light. She extends her arms elegantly while maintaining fluid poses, showcasing the smooth texture of her solid-colored clothing against the symmetrical architecture. Her actions are deliberate and poised, highlighting the cultural essence of the scene as she moves gracefully through various arm-outstretched and bent-knee positions.
