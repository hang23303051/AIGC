A female tennis player, dressed in a blue dress and red shoes with braided hair, stands on a bright outdoor court preparing to serve. She tosses a yellow tennis ball into the air while holding a blue and yellow racket, her right arm raised high as she looks intently at the ball above her head. The net is visible behind her, stretching across the blue surface of the court marked with white lines, under clear daylight conditions.
