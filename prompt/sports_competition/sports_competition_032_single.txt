A woman in a pink vest, white shorts, white shoes, and a white visor stands on a well-manicured golf course under bright sunlight, holding a golf club. She bends down to place a yellow golf ball next to a small USGA logo box with blue, red, and white colors before preparing to swing the club. The background features lush green trees and another person standing near a body of water, wearing a blue shirt and khaki shorts. As she swings, her posture twists gracefully, showcasing focused determination against the serene outdoor setting.
