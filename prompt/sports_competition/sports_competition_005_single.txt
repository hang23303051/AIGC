Two individuals are on a snowy mountain slope under a cloudy sky. The person in the blue snowsuit, equipped with a green snowboard and backpack, is seen crawling before lying down flat on the snow. Meanwhile, the person in the black jacket, wearing red socks and skis, stands atop their back, drinking from a bottle while maintaining balance. In another scene, two more people join; one lies face down as the other sits astride them, mimicking the earlier action. Snow-covered mountains stretch into the distance, creating a scenic winter backdrop for this playful "lazy skiing" activity.
